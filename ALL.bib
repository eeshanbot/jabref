We present results while the human plays against robots of different intelligence levels and determines their level of trust of each robot as a potential teammate through a post experiment questionnaire. We also present our exploration of heart rate measures as approximations of cognitive load. It is our goal to determine guidelines for future autonomy and interaction designers such that their systems will reduce cognitive load and increase the level of trust in robot teammates. This is an initial experiment that uses the least amount of vehicles yet still gathers competitive data on the water. Future experiments will increase in complexity to many opponents and many teammates.},

Here we pair detailed hydrographic and bathymetric measurements collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle as close as 150 m from the ice-ocean interface of the Saqqarliup sermia-Sarqardleq Fjord system, West Greenland, with modeled and observed subglacial discharge locations and magnitudes. We find evidence of two main types of subsurface glacially modified water (GMW) with distinct properties and locations. The two GMW locations also align with modeled runoff discharged at separate locations along the grounded margin corresponding with two prominent subcatchments beneath Saqqarliup sermia. Thus, near-ice observations and subglacial discharge routing indicate that runoff from this glacier occurs primarily at two discrete locations and gives rise to two distinct glacially modified waters. Furthermore, we show that the location with the largest subglacial discharge is associated with the lighter, fresher glacially modified water mass. This is qualitatively consistent with results from an idealized plume model.},

As permafrost soils thaw owing to climate warming, respiration of organic matter within these soils will transfer carbon to the atmosphere, potentially leading to a positive feedback 2. Models in which the carbon cycle is uncoupled from the atmosphere, together with one-dimensional models, suggest that permafrost soils could release 7-138 Pg carbon by 2100 (refs 3, 4). Here, we use a coupled global climate model to quantify the magnitude of the warming generated by the feedback between permafrost carbon release and climate. According to our simulations, permafrost soils will release between 68 and 508 Pg carbon by 2100. We show that the additional surface warming generated by the feedback between permafrost carbon and climate is independent of the pathway of anthropogenic emissions followed in the twenty-first century. We estimate that this feedback could result in an additional warming of 0.13-1.69 • C by 2300. We further show that the upper bound for the strength of the feedback is reached under the less intensive emissions pathways. We suggest that permafrost},

These quantities, combined with independent measurements of hydrophone depths and cable inclination, are converted into range-depth position fixes by implementing an efficient numerical procedure that uses a ray-tracing code to account for ray-refraction effects caused by depth-dependent sound speed profiles. Analytic expressions that assume a constant waterborne sound speed are also derived. Foraging depths of various sperm whales over 10 days in June, 2004 are estimated using the numerical technique.},

The system reported herein, which is employed to renavigate the vehicle in post-processing, forms the basis for a vehicle-based real-time navigation system. Existing high-precision absolute navigation techniques for underwater vehicles are impractical over long length scales and lack scalability for simultaneously navigating multiple vehicles. The navigation method reported in this paper relies on a single moving reference beacon, eliminating the requirement for the underwater vehicle to remain in a bounded navigable area. The use of underwater modems and synchronous clocks enables range measurements based on one-way time-of-flight information from acoustic data packet broadcasts. The acoustic data packets are broadcast from the single, moving reference beacon and can be received simultaneously by multiple vehicles within acoustic range. We report experimental results from the first deep-water evaluation of this method using data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) survey carried out in 4000 m of water on the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We report a comparative experimental evaluation of the navigation fixes provided by the proposed synchronous acoustic navigation system in comparison to navigation fixes obtained by an independent conventional long baseline acoustic navigation system.},

These recordings were used to test a new approach to localizing the whales that exploits the time-difference of arrival ͑time lag͒ of their calls as measured between receiver pairs in the PMRF network. The usual technique for estimating source position uses the intersection of hyperbolic curves of constant time lag, but a drawback of this approach is its assumption of a constant wave speed and straight-line propagation to associate acoustic travel time with range. In contrast to hyperbolic fixing, the algorithm described here uses an acoustic propagation model to account for waveguide and multipath effects when estimating travel time from hypothesized source positions. A comparison between predicted and measured time lags forms an ambiguity surface, or visual representation of the most probable whale position in a horizontal plane around the array. This is an important benefit because it allows for automated peak extraction to provide a location estimate. Examples of whale localizations using real and simulated data in algorithms of increasing complexity are provided.},

Traditional navigation algorithms have used OWTT measurements to constrain an inertial navigation system aided by a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). These methodologies limit AUV applications to where DVL bottom-lock is available as well as the necessity for expensive strap-down sensors, such as the DVL. Thus, deep water, mid-water column research has mostly been left untouched, and vehicles that need expensive strap-down sensors restrict the possibility of using multiple AUVs to explore a certain area. This work presents a solution for accurate navigation and localization using a vehicle's odometry determined by its dynamic model velocity and constrained by OWTT range measurements from a topside source beacon as well as other AUVs operating in proximity. We present a comparison of two navigation algorithms: an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a Particle Filter(PF). Both of these algorithms also incorporate a water velocity bias estimator that further enhances the navigation accuracy and localization. Closed-loop online field results on local waters as well as a real-time implementation of two days field trials operating in Monterey Bay, California during the Keck Institute for Space Studies oceanographic research project prove the accuracy of this methodology with a root mean square error on the order of tens of meters compared to GPS position over a distance traveled of multiple kilometers.},

At scales between 10 and 200 km, the ADCP kinetic energy spectra approximately follow a k 23 power law. The observed flows are more energetic at the surface, but the shape of the kinetic energy spectra is independent of depth. These characteristics resemble predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The ratio of across-track to along-track kinetic energy spectra, however, significantly departs from the expectation of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The inconsistency is dramatic at scales smaller than 40 km. A Helmholtz decomposition of the ADCP spectra and analyses of synthetic and numerical model data show that horizontally divergent, ageostrophic flows account for the discrepancy between the observed spectra and predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. In Drake Passage, ageostrophic motions appear to be dominated by inertia-gravity waves and account for about half of the near-surface kinetic energy at scales between 10 and 40 km. Model results indicate that ageostrophic flows imprint on the sea surface, accounting for about half of the sea surface height variance between 10 and 40 km.},

Continuous measurements west of San Nicolas Island, California, over 138 days, spanning 2003-2004 are compared to measurements made during the 1960s at the same site. Ambient noise levels at 30-50 Hz were 10-12 dB higher ͑95% CI= 2.6 dB͒ in 2003-2004 than in 1964-1966, suggesting an average noise increase rate of 2.5-3 dB per decade. Above 50 Hz the noise level differences between recording periods gradually diminished to only 1-3 dB at 100-300 Hz. Above 300 Hz the 1964-1966 ambient noise levels were higher than in 2003-2004, owing to a diel component which was absent in the more recent data. Low frequency ͑10-50 Hz͒ ocean ambient noise levels are closely related to shipping vessel traffic. The number of commercial vessels plying the world's oceans approximately doubled between 1965 and 2003 and the gross tonnage quadrupled, with a corresponding increase in horsepower. Increases in commercial shipping are believed to account for the observed low-frequency ambient noise increase.},

Eubalaena glacialis and their copepod prey, late-stage Calanus finmarchicus, was monitored at an
oceanographic station in Grand Manan Basin of the lower Bay of Fundy for 29 h on 2 separate occa-
sions. The vertical distribution of C. finmarchicus was measured at 1/2 h intervals with an optical
plankton counter (OPC) and at 6 or 12 h intervals with a MOCNESS. Right whale abundance was
estimated from periodic point scans. Late-stage C. finmarchicus exhibited diel vertical migration in
the upper 100 m of the water column, but the bulk of the population remained at depths below 100 m
throughout both the day and night and was likely in diapause. Diel vertical migration is unlikely to
be influenced by right whales, but may instead be motivated by abundant, near-surface food
resources and avoidance of visual predators. Right whale sighting rate was correlated with OPC-
detected C. finmarchicus fifth copepodite (C5) abundance at mid-depths (90–140 m); variability in
both right whale sighting rate and C. finmarchicus C5 abundance in this depth stratum appeared to
have similar periodicity to that of the tide. Energetic considerations suggest that right whales
continue to feed on deep, diapausing layers of C. finmarchicus during the night, but the occasional
presence of exploitable near-surface concentrations of C. finmarchicus suggests that nighttime
near-surface feeding might sometimes occur.},

  abstract  = {Sea ice freeboard heights in the Weddell Sea of Antarctica are derived from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter measurements, which have a unique range precision to flat surfaces of 2 cm within 70 m footprints spaced at 172 m along track. Although elevations of flat surfaces can be obtained to an accuracy of $10 cm (1s) per footprint, direct determination of freeboard heights is precluded by errors in knowledge of the geoid and temporal variability of the ocean surface. Therefore freeboards are determined relative to an ocean reference level detected over areas of open water and very thin ice within the sea ice pack using an along-track filtering method. The open water/thin ice selections show good agreement in the combined analysis of ICESat segments and Envisat Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The average residual between the ICESat-measured ocean level and the EGM96 geoid is 1.4 m. Estimates of snow depth on the sea ice from AMSR-E passive microwave data along with nominal densities of snow, water, and sea ice are used to estimate sea ice thickness. Four periods of ICESat data in May-June (fall) and October-November (late winter) of 2004 and 2005 between longitudes 298°E and 360°E are analyzed. In the fall the mean freeboards are 0.28 m in 2004 and 0.29 m in 2005, and the mean thicknesses are 1.33 m in 2004 and 1.52 m in 2005. In late winter the freeboards grew to 0.37 m in 2004 and 0.35 in 2005, and the thicknesses grew to 2.23 m in 2004 and 2.31 m in 2005. The interannual differences in freeboard are small, and the larger interannual change in estimated thickness mainly represents differences in the snow depth estimates. Seasonal changes in the spatial patterns of freeboard and thickness over the 4 months correlate with the expected circulation of sea ice in the Weddell Sea, as indicated by sea ice velocity fields.},

  abstract  = {Deep-sea ecosystems have attracted considerable commercial interest in recent years because of their potential to sustain a diverse range of mankind's industrial needs. If these systems are to be preserved or exploited in a sustainable manner, mapping habitats and species distributions is critical. As biodiversity at cold-seeps or other deep-sea ecosystems is driven by habitat heterogeneity, imagery is the obvious choice for characterizing these systems and has indeed proven extremely valuable towards mapping biogenic habitats formed by dense aggregations of large sized species, such as coral reefs, tubeworm bushes or bivalve beds. However, the acquisition of detailed images with resolution sufficient for reliable identification is extremely time consuming, labor intensive and highly susceptible to logistical issues. We developed a novel method for quickly mapping cold seep fauna and habitats over large areas, at the scale of squares of kilometers. Our method uses multibeam echosounder bathymetry and acoustic backscatter data, both segmented and reclassified based on topographical features and then combined to obtain a raster containing unique values incorporating both backscatter and bathymetry data. Two datasets, obtained from 30 m and 8 m above the seafloor were used and the results from the two datasets were compared. The method was applied to a cold seep community located in a pockmark in the deep Congo channel and we were able to ground truth the accuracy of our method against images of the area. The two datasets, obtained from different altitudes gave varying results: the 8 m altitude dataset reliably predicted tubeworms and carbonate rock, while the 30 m altitude dataset predicted tubeworms and vesicomyid clams. The 30 m dataset was more accurate than the 8 m altitude dataset in predicting distributions of tubeworms. Overall, all the predictions were quite accurate, with at least 90% of predictions being within 5 m of real distributions.},

  title    = {Resolving power and sensitivity to mismatch of optimum array processors},
  year     = {9215},
  abstract = {Mismatch in a beamformer occurs when the knowledge of the signal directional properties is imprecise. The effects of mismatch on a conventional beamformer and two optimum beamformers are compared. One optimum beamformer is based on inversion of the noise cross-spectral matrix while the other is based on inversion of the signal-plus-noise cross-spectral matrix. When there is mismatch, the inclusion of the signal in the matfix inversion process can lead to dramatic reductions in the output signal-to-noise ratio when the output signal-tonoise ratio of a perfectly matched beamformer would be greater than unity. However, the corresponding effect on the total beamformer output is less dramatic since an increase in the noise rcspous½ partially offsets the decrease in signal response. The question of suppressing mismatched signals is closely related to the question of resolving closely spaced sources. Exact conditions are presented for resolution of closely spaced sources by an optimum beamformer. These results are applied to a line array and compared with the resolution capability of a conventional beamformer. It is found, for example, that an output signal-to-noise ratio of about 47 dB is required to achieve a resolving power with an optimum processor which is ten times that given by the classical Rayleigh limit. Conditions are also presented for the resolution of two sources of unequal strength.},

  abstract  = {An automated, easily deployed Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) instrument system, developed for deployment on perennial sea ice in the polar oceans to measure changes in upper ocean water properties in all seasons, is described, and representative data from prototype instruments are presented. The ITP instrument consists of three components: a surface subsystem that sits atop an ice floe; a weighted, plastic-jacketed wire-rope tether of arbitrary length (up to 800 m) suspended from the surface element; and an instrumented underwater unit that employs a traction drive to profile up and down the wire tether. ITPs profile the water column at a programmed sampling interval; after each profile, the underwater unit transfers two files holding oceanographic and engineering data to the surface unit using an inductive modem and from the surface instrument to a shore-based data server using an Iridium transmitter. The surface instrument also accumulates battery voltage readings, buoy temperature data, and locations from a GPS receiver at a specified interval (usually every hour) and transmits those data daily. Oceanographic and engineering data are processed, displayed, and made available in near-real time (available online at http://www.whoi.edu/ itp). Six ITPs were deployed in the Arctic Ocean between 2004 and 2006 in the Beaufort gyre with various programmed sampling schedules of two to six one-way traverses per day between 10-and 750-760-m depth, providing more than 5300 profiles in all seasons (as of July 2007). The acquired CTD profile data document interesting spatial variations in the major water masses of the Canada Basin, show the double-diffusive thermohaline staircase that lies above the warm, salty Atlantic layer, measure seasonal surface mixed layer deepening, and document several mesoscale eddies. Augmenting the systems already deployed and to replace expiring systems, an international array of more than one dozen ITPs will be deployed as part of the Arctic Observing Network during the International Polar Year (IPY) period (2007-08) holding promise for more valuable real-time upper ocean observations for operational needs, to support studies of ocean processes, and to facilitate numerical model initialization and validation.},

Data on call types and individual rates of sound production are necessary to use passive acoustics to identify species, assess individual detectability, and estimate the number of individuals present. The present study describes the sound production behavior of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, during July and August, recorded with suction cup archival tags (Dtag) in 2000 to 2002 and 2005. The Dtag simultaneously recorded acoustic data from a hydrophone along with the depth and orientation of the whale. Over 168 h of acoustic data were obtained from 46 tag deployments (35 ind.), with an average attachment duration of 4.5 h. The rate of sound production was variable, ranging from 0 to 200 calls h −1 (mean ± SD: 6.4 ± 29.8 calls h −1), with 28 of the 46 tagged whales producing no calls (corresponding to 69/168 h of data). Right whale sounds from any whale in the area were recorded on most tag records, indicating that aggregations of whales may be detected more reliably than individuals. Calling rates were highest during surface activity and traveling and lowest during foraging and logging behavior. Whales of both sexes and all age-classes produced upcalls and other tonal calls, and 1 adult male produced gunshot sounds. The present study provides insight from the largest extant collection of recordings of individual North Atlantic right whales into the acoustic detectability of individual right whales and demonstrates that the behavioral state is the primary factor affecting calling rate.},

This study documents the structure for an anticyclonic eddy in the Iceland Basin using high-resolution hydrographic and velocity observations. The eddy core waters have lens-like structure with warm and salty features in the upper 1,000 m. The eddy distorts the density surface by doming the upper isopycnals and deepening the ones near the permanent pycnocline. The eddy has a diameter of about 120 km with substantial barotropic component in the velocity profiles. One branch of the North Atlantic Current in the central Iceland Basin is superimposed onto the eddy, leading to asymmetric velocity structure. Satellite maps show that eddy first shows up over the western slope of the Hatton Bank and moves westward to the central Iceland Basin. The waters enclosed in the eddy core share the same properties with Subpolar Mode Waters. Similar anticyclonic eddies are also found in high-resolution numerical model simulations, which is used to explore eddy formation. The model results reveal that the potential vorticity gradient prior to the eddy event change signs in both horizontal and vertical directions. This potential vorticity gradient structure meets the necessary condition for the barotropic and baroclinic instabilities. Further calculation of the energy conversions suggests that eddies extract mean potential energy from the large-scale isopycnal slope and gain the mean kinetic energy in the upper ocean. Therefore, both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities are involved to support the eddy growth.},

The location of the array, near 58-59°N, captures the ISOW plume at the farthest downstream location in the Iceland Basin before significant amounts of ISOW can flow into the Irminger Basin through deep fractures in the Reykjanes Ridge. The net transport of the ISOW plume at this location-approximately 5.3Sv based on the first 4 years of observations-is significantly larger than previous values obtained farther north in the Iceland Basin, suggesting that either previous measurements did not fully capture the plume transport or that additional entrainment into the ISOW plume occurs as it approaches the southern tip of the Reykjanes Ridge. A detailed water mass analysis of the plume from continuous temperature/salinity observations shows that about 50% of the plume transport (2.6Sv) is derived from dense waters flowing over the Nordic Sea sills into the Iceland Basin, while the remainder is made up of nearly equal parts of entrained Atlantic thermocline water and modified Labrador Sea Water. The overall results from this study suggest that the ISOW plume approximately doubles its transport through entrainment, similar to that of the Denmark Strait overflow plume in the Irminger Sea that forms the other major overflow source of North Atlantic Deep Water.},

  publisher = {IEEE},
  abstract  = {This paper describes an acoustic navigation system that provides mesoscale coverage (hundreds of kilometers) under the ice and presents results from the first multi-month deployment in the Arctic. The hardware consists of ice-tethered acoustic navigation beacons transmitting at 900 Hz that broadcast their latitude and longitude plus several bytes of optional control data. The real-time under-ice navigation algorithm, based on a Kalman filter, uses time-of-flight measurements from these sources to simultaneously estimate vehicle position and depth-averaged local currents. The algorithm described herein was implemented on Seagliders, a type of autonomous underwater glider (AUG), but the underlying theory is applicable to other autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). As part of an extensive field campaign from March to September 2014, eleven acoustic sources and four Seagliders were deployed to monitor the seasonal melt of the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Beaufort and northern Chukchi Seas. Beacon-to-beacon performance was excellent due to a sound duct at 100 m depth where the transmitters were positioned; the travel-time error at 200 km has a standard deviation of 40 m when sound-speed is known, and ranges in excess of 400 km were obtained. Results with the Seagliders, which were not regularly within the duct, showed reliable acoustic ranges up to 100 km and more sparse but repeatable range measurements to over 400 km. Navigation results are reported for the real-time algorithm run in postprocessing mode, using data from a 295-hour segment with significant time spent under ice.},

The model results demonstrate that, in addition to the known westward flow through the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ), some Iceland Scotland overflow water (ISOW) flows westward through gaps in the Reykjanes Ridge north of the CGFZ into the Irminger Sea, and some flows southward along the eastern flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge into the West European Basin. These results provide insights into the well-known inconsistency between observed westward transport of ISOW through the CGFZ (2.4 Sv) and the transports upstream at Southeast of Iceland section (3.2 Sv) and downstream in the western Irminger Sea (4.5 Sv). Although the portion of the simulated ISOW that flows through CGFZ is about 500 m deeper than observed, the model results also show two ISOW pathways of this flow into the Irminger Sea, one northward along the western flank of the Reykjanes Ridge and the other westward before turning north-eastward on the western side of the Irminger Basin. Comparisons with the long-term moored instrument database in the Irminger Sea show that the model-based mean circulation is in reasonable agreement with observed volume transports of overflow water and that it gives approximately correct temperature and salinity characteristics.},

On January 13, 2013 from Ny-A ˚lesund, several polar cap patches were observed to exit the polar cap into the auroral oval, and were then termed auroral blobs. This gave us an unprecedented opportunity to compare the relative scintillation levels associated with these three phenomena. The blobs were associated with the strongest phase scintillation (r /), followed by patches and arcs, with r / up to 0.6, 0.5, and 0.1 rad, respectively. Our observations indicate that most patches in the nightside polar cap have produced significant scintillations, but not all of them. Since the blobs are formed after patches merged into auroral regions, in space weather predictions of GPS scintillations, it will be important to enable predictions of patches exiting the polar cap.},

  abstract = {A new approach for the inversion of travel-time data is proposed, based on the matching between model arrivals and observed peaks. Using the linearized model relations between sound-speed and arrival-time perturbations about a set of background states, arrival times and associated errors are calculated on a fine grid of model states discretizing the sound-speed parameter space. Each model state can explain ͑identify͒ a number of observed peaks in a particular reception lying within the uncertainty intervals of the corresponding predicted arrival times. The model states that explain the maximum number of observed peaks are considered as the more likely parametric descriptions of the reception; these model states can be described in terms of mean values and variances providing a statistical answer ͑matched-peak solution͒ to the inversion problem. A basic feature of the matched-peak inversion approach is that each reception can be treated independently, i.e., no constraints are posed from previous-reception identification or inversion results. Accordingly, there is no need for initialization of the inversion procedure and, furthermore, discontinuous travel-time data can be treated. The matched-peak inversion method is demonstrated by application to 9-month-long travel-time data from the Thetis-2 tomography experiment in the western Mediterranean sea.},

Ambient noise recording was carried out by a bottom mounted sensor at 30 m depth at regular interval for a period of over one month and the spectrum in the band 10-1.6 kHz was characterized for its diurnal spectral variation. The study concluded that the distant shipping noise component due to heavy small vessel activity in the nearby port resulted in up to 35 dB variation in the shallow water ambient noise in coastal areas that may have serious implication on passive surveillance algorithms performance in the vicinity if adequately not addressed.

This presents a challenge to existing ray-tracing based methods, which are widely adopted to simulate propagation due to their efficiency and flexibility, but assume linear rays. We present a novel algorithm that traces analytic ray curves computed from local media gradients, and utilizes the closed-form solutions of both the intersections of the ray curves with planar surfaces, and the travel distance. By constructing an adaptive unstructured mesh, our algorithm is able to model general media profiles that vary in three dimensions with complex boundaries consisting of terrains and other scene objects such as buildings. We trace the analytic ray curves using the adaptive unstructured mesh, which considerably improves the efficiency over prior methods. We highlight the algorithm's application on simulation of sound and visual propagation in outdoor scenes.},

  abstract = {A new approach based on statistical estimation is proposed for the analysis of tomographic traveltime data in cases of significant nonlinear dependence of the traveltimes on the sound-speed variations. Traditional tomography schemes based on linear perturbative inversions about a single, a priori fixed background state cannot properly handle such cases since the linearized model relations will lead to considerable inversion errors, depending on the extent of nonlinearity. In contrast, the background state is considered here as a variable unknown quantity to be estimated from the traveltime data, simultaneously with the peak identification function and the sound-speed perturbation. Using the maximum likelihood approach and the Gaussian assumption, the statistical estimation problem reduces to a weighted least squares problem to be solved simultaneously for the three unknown quantities. A posteriori inversion-error estimates are derived accounting also for uncertainties in the background selection and the peak identification. The proposed method is applied to nine-month-long traveltime data from the Thetis-2 experiment, conducted from January to October 1994 in the Western Mediterranean Sea, where the variability of the ocean environment gives rise to significant nonlinear dependencies between sound-speed and traveltime variations. The recovered temporal variability and stratification compare well with independent XBT observations.},

Since 1999, an array of bottom-mounted acoustic instruments measuring current velocity and bottom-to-surface acoustic travel times was deployed at the sill. Here, the optimization of the array configuration based on a numerical overflow model is discussed. The simulation proves that more than 80% of the dense water transport variability is captured by two to three acoustic current profilers (ADCPs). The results are compared with time series from ADCPs and Inverted Echo Sounders deployed from 1999 to 2003, confirming that the dense overflow plume can be reliably measured by bottom-mounted instruments and that the overflow is largely geostrophically balanced at the sill.},

Accurate and robust localization for low-cost AUVs would lower the barrier toward multi-AUV research in river and ocean environments. However, these AUVs introduce size, power, and cost constraints that prevent the use of conventional AUV sensors and acoustic positioning systems, adding great difficulty to the problem of underwater localization. Our system uses a single acoustic transmitter placed at a reference point and is acoustically passive on the AUV, reducing cost and power use, and enabling multi-AUV localization. The AUV has an ultrashort baseline (USBL) receiver array that uses one-way traveltime (OWTT) and phased-array beamforming to calculate range, azimuth, and inclination to the transmitter, providing an instantaneous estimate of the vehicle location. This estimate is fed to a particle filter and graph-based smoothing algorithm to generate a consistent AUV trajectory. We describe the complete processing pipeline of our system, and present results based on experiments using a low-cost AUV. To the authors' knowledge, this work constitutes the first practical demonstration of the feasibility of OWTT inverted USBL navigation for AUVs.},

If released within a short period, the excess freshwater could potentially impact the large-scale ocean circulation by freshening the upper subpolar North Atlantic. Here, we track BG-sourced freshwater using passive tracers in a global ocean sea-ice model and show that this freshwater exited the Arctic mostly through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, rather than Fram Strait, during an historical release event in 1983-1995. The Labrador Sea is the most affected region in the subpolar North Atlantic, with a freshening of 0.2 psu on the western shelves and 0.4 psu in the Labrador Current. Given that the present BG freshwater content anomaly is twice the historical analog studied here, the impact of a future rapid release on Labrador Sea salinity could be significant, easily exceeding similar fluxes from Greenland meltwater.},

  abstract = {Successful command and control (C2) of autonomous vehicles poses challenges that are unique to the marine environment, primarily highly restrictive acoustic communications throughput. To address this, the Unified C2 architecture presented here uses a highly compressed short message encoding scheme (Dynamic Compact Control Language or DCCL) to transfer commands and receive vehicle status. DCCL is readily reconfigurable to provide the flexibility needed to change commands on short notice. Furthermore, operation of multiple types of vehicles requires a C2 architecture that is both scalable and flexible to differences among platform hardware and abilities. The Unified C2 architecture uses the MOOS-IvP autonomy system to act as a “backseat driver” of the vehicle. This provides a uniform interface to the control system on all the vehicles. Also, a hierarchical configuration system is used to allow single changes in configuration to propagate to all vehicles in operation. Status data from all vehicles are displayed visually using Google Earth, which also allows a rapid meshing of data from other sources (sensors, automatic identification system, radar, satellites) from within, as well as outside of, the MOOS-IvP architecture.

As part of the recent ICEX16 US Navy Exercise in the Beaufort Sea, MIT deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle with a towed hydrophone array below the ice cover for assessing the climate induced changes to the undersea ambient noise environment. The safe underwater operation depended on navigation updates from the submarine tracking range being communicated to the vehicle for fusion with the onboard inertial navigation. However, the changes in the environment severely deteriorated the tracking performance compared to previous deployments. The reason was clearly associated with a previously observed neutrally bouyant layer of warm Pacific water persistently spreading throughout the Beaufort Sea, which severely alters the acoustic environment with dramatic effects for both long and short range acoustic sensing, communication and navigation. This paper describes the effects observed and discusses how robust acoustic connectivity in this environment makes it paramount that the manned or unmanned undersea platforms are capable of adapting to the environment for sensing, communication and navigation.},

	abstract = {A one-year ﬁxed-path observation of seasonally varying subsurface ducted sound propagation in the Beaufort Sea is presented. The ducted and surface-interacting sounds have different time behaviors. To understand this, a surfaceforced computational model of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas with ice cover is used to simulate local conditions, which are then used to computationally simulate sound propagation. A sea ice module is employed to grow/melt ice and to transfer heat and momentum through the ice. The model produces a time- and space-variable duct as observed, with Paciﬁc Winter Water (PWW) beneath a layer of Paciﬁc Summer Water (PSW) and above warm Atlantic water. In the model, PSW moves northward from the Alaskan coastal area in late summer to strengthen the sound duct, and then mean PSW temperature decreases during winter and spring, reducing the duct effectiveness, one cause of a duct annual cycle. Spatially, the modeled PSW is strained and ﬁlamentary, with horizontally structured temperature. Sound simulations (order 200 Hz) suggest that ducting is interrupted by the intermittency of the PSW (duct gaps), with gaps enabling loss from ice cover (set constant in the sound model). The gaps and ducted sound show seasonal tendencies but also exhibit random process behavior. VC 2021 Acoustical Society of America.},

	abstract = {The Arctic Ocean is undergoing dramatic changes, the most apparent being the rapidly reducing extent and thickness of the summer ice cover. As has been well established over prior decades, the environmental acoustics of the ice-covered Arctic is dominated by two major effects: the highly inhomogeneous ice cover, and the monotonically upward refracting sound speed profile, the combination of which forces all sound paths to be exposed to strong scattering loss and the associated loss of coherence. In some portions of the Arctic Ocean, however, a persistent inflow of a shallow ‘tongue’ of warm Pacific water has recently been strengthening, which has dramatically altered the acoustic environment, creating a strong acoustic duct between approximately 100 and 200 m depth. This duct has the potential of trapping sound out to significant ranges (80-100 km) without interacting with the ice cover, resulting in much higher coherence and signal preservation. Acoustic noise measurement results collected with a vertically suspended array during ICEX 2016 illustrate the spatial and temporal noise properties in the presence of this acoustic duct at different depths. Comparisons of the ICEX 2016 data are also made with modeled Arctic noise data.},

	abstract = {This paper reports recent experimental results in the development and deployment of a synchronous-clock acoustic navigation system suitable for the simultaneous navigation of multiple underwater vehicles. The goal of this work is to enable the task of navigating multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) over length scales of C(IUO km), while maintaining error tolerances commensurate with conventional long-baseline transponder-based navigation systems (i.e., O(1 m)), but without the requisite need for deploying, calibrating, and recovering seafloor anchored acoustic transponders. Our navigation system is comprised of an acoustic modem-based communication/ navigation system that allows for onboard navigational data to be broadcast as a data packet by a source node, and for all passively receiving nodes to be able to decode the data packet to obtain a one-way travel time pseudo-range measurement and ephemeris data. We present results for two different field experiments using a two-node configuration consisting of a global positioning system (GPS) equipped surface ship acting as a global navigation aid to a Doppler-aided AUV. In each experiment, vehicle position was independently corroborated by other standard navigation means. Initial results for a maximum-likelihood sensor fusion framework are reported. © 2007 IEEE.},

Ambient noise from the Beaufort Sea recorded in experiments more than 20 years apart (SIMI94 and ICEX16) are compared to determine differences that may be attributed to the region's rapidly changing environment. Spectral comparison shows noise within 20–350 Hz is ∼30 dB louder in 1994 than 2016; however, this is likely due to higher array self noise during SIMI94. Beamforming results show ambient noise vertical directionality is focused near the horizontal during SIMI94 but more spread in elevation during ICEX16, with a robust noise notch at the horizontal. Numerical modeling demonstrates that this difference may be attributed to ambient noise during ICEX16 being dominated by surface noise sources at discrete ranges rather than the historical assumption of a continuous and uniform distribution of sources. Temporal statistics of transient ice events show more acoustic activity during SIMI94 than ICEX16 and appear to support the new proposed surface source distribution for ICEX16.},

Underwater communications are low bandwidth and unreliable, and there is no access to a global positioning system.

While these methods are useful, their performance is fundamentally limited. Advances in underwater communications and the application of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology to the underwater realm have yielded new possibilities in the field.

Additionally, the virtual ocean channel simulator is designed to perform in real time by coupling less frequent asynchronous queries to high-fidelity models of the ocean environment and acoustic propagation with frequent pertubation-based updates for the exact position of the simulated AUVs. The results demonstrate the performance of this system using the WHOI Micro-Modem 2 hardware in the virtual ocean environment of the Arctic Beaufort Sea around 73 degrees latitude.

A horizontal profile of vertical water velocity is obtained by applying a Kalman smoother to AUV motion data. The smoother uses a linearized model for vehicle motion and vehicle data such as depth, pitch, and pitch rate to produce an optimal estimate of the state of the system, which includes other vehicle variables and the vertical water velocity. Vertical water velocity estimated by applying the smoother to data from the autonomous microconductivity temperature vehicle (AMTV) is accurate at horizontal scales from three to several hundred meters, encompassing the energy-containing scales of most oceanic turbulence. The zero-lag covariances between vertical water velocity and concurrent measurements of temperature or salinity represent the heat and salt fluxes, respectively. The authors have measured horizontal profiles of turbulent fluxes with two different AUVs in three separate polar ocean experiments using this technique. Flux magnitudes and directions are reasonable and in general agreement with fixed turbulence sensors. With this technique, one can gather boundary layer data in inaccessible regions without disturbing or affecting the surface.},

	abstract = {The absence of the global positioning system (GPS) is a challenge to navigation and localization in the underwater environment. Thus, for precise and accurate navigation, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) often rely on very precise (yet very expensive and high energy consumption) inertial strap-down sensors which require external observations to constrain their dead-reckoned position error over time-e.g., Doppler velocity logs (DVLs) or acoustic positioning systems. Recent advances in acoustic navigation methodologies are enabling AUVs to extend submerged mission time by providing external position corrections and thereby constraining position error. Additionally, advances in microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensor technology has drastically lowered the size, power consumption, and cost of inertial sensors; however, they are still noisy and accumulate error over time. This paper builds on recent advances in single beacon one-way-travel-time (OWTT) acoustic navigation and investigates the degree of bounding position error for small AUVs with a minimal navigation strap-down sensor suite, relying on a consumer grade MEMS inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a vehicle's dynamic model velocity. A real time implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), containing bias estimation, is obtained in the field with two Ocean-Server, Inc. Iver2 vehicles, and results show an average position error of 10.26 meters and 12.95 meters over a distance traveled of 1.73 kilometers and 1.91 kilometers, respectively.},

Because the sources transmitted at 9-min intervals the glider moved appreciably between source receptions. Source-glider ranges estimated from acoustic arrivals were combined using least squares analysis to estimate glider position and velocity during each reception period. The analysis was applied to 387 sets of source transmissions using three different flight models of glider subsurface motion for initial position input values. The offsets between the position estimated from the flight models and the acoustically derived position resulting from the inversions were 600-900-m root mean square (rms) depending upon the model and input parameters. The offsets were tripled if the positions from the flight models were not corrected for a dive-averaged current (DAC). Estimates of a posteriori errors ranged from 78-105-m rms and from 9.1-11.6-cm/s rms for glider position and velocity, respectively. Data residuals were on the order of 50-m rms, a dramatic reduction from 178-m rms, which was documented for the case neglecting the motion of the glider between subsequent source transmissions (Van Uffelen , J. Acoust. Soc. Amer., vol. 134, pp. 3260-3271, 2013). Overall horizontal glider speed was estimated to be approximately 21-cm/s rms.},

  abstract  = {Spherical positioning systems determine position by measuring acoustic travel times from beacons at known locations. To make this travel time measurement, the receiver must know exactly when each beacon transmitted. Hyperbolic positioning systems determine position by measuring differences in travel time between signals from the beacons. The hyperbolic receiver does not need to know when the beacons transmitted, only that they all transmitted at the same time or with known delays relative to each other. The spherical system, which must know transmit time exactly, and the hyperbolic system, which does not know transmit time at all can be seen as the two endpoints of a continuum of systems parameterized by the accuracy with which the transmit time is known. This paper demonstrates that the Cramer-Rao bounds for position accuracy approach those of the spherical navigation system as the variance in the transmit time estimate approaches zero, and approach those of the hyperbolic positioning system as the variance in the transmit time estimate becomes infinite. This observation has practical application in that the position accuracy of a hyperbolic navigation system which transmits at regular time intervals may be improved if it estimates not only receiver position, but also the transmit time of the beacons. As the estimate of transmit time improves, the position resolution becomes closer to that of a spherical positioning system. This improvement in position accuracy is shown for a typical underwater acoustic positioning scenario.},

  abstract  = {Acoustic positioning systems typically use the first acoustic arrival from each beacon to determine ranges to known beacon locations, and subsequent multipath arrivals are blanked out. As long as the first arrival is reliably present, these systems are dependable, but in many realistic positioning scenarios, the expected first arrival may be blocked by underwater obstacles or masked by noise. If a subsequent multipath arrival is mistaken for the missing first arrival, a position error will result. This paper presents a positioning system which uses the full multipath structure of the received signal to make the system robust to the fading of individual arrivals. The system determines its position by a two-step process. First, the detected arrivals in the multipath structure are identified with physical ray paths through the environment using a new algorithm which is robust to the disappearance of a subset of the predicted and measured arrivals. Then, the differences in arrival times between the measured arrivals and the predicted ray arrivals are used in a linear inversion to produce a position estimate. The operation of the system is simulated in a typical coastal environment where arrivals become unexpectedly absent due to blocking by unknown bottom topography, and where a high ambient noise level often produces missed arrivals and false detections.},

These surveys were unique among AUV operations to date in requiring georeferenced navigation in proximity to the seafloor beneath permanent and moving ice cover. We report results for long-baseline (LBL) acoustic navigation during autonomous under-ice surveys near the seafloor and adaptation of the LBL concept for several typical operational situations including navigation in proximity to the ship during vehicle recoveries. Fixed seafloor transponders were free-fall deployed from the ship for deep positioning. The ship's helicopter collected acoustic travel times from several locations to georeference the transponders' locations, subject to the availability of openings in the ice. Two shallow beacons suspended from the ship provided near-surface spherical navigation in ship-relative coordinates. During routine recoveries, we used this system to navigate the vehicles into open water near the ship before commanding them to surface. In cases in which a vehicle was impaired, its position was still determined acoustically through some combination of its acoustic modem, the fixed seafloor transponders, the ship-deployed transponders, and an onboard backup relay transponder. The techniques employed included ranging adapted for a moving origin and hyperbolic navigation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The differences between the 2D and 3D TSKs average out when horizontal or cross-range marginals are considered, which indicates that they are not important in the case of range-independent sound-speed perturbations or perturbations of large scale compared to the lateral TSK extent. With increasing range, the wave-theoretic TSKs expand in the horizontal cross-range direction, their cross-range extent being comparable to that of the corresponding free-space Fresnel zone, whereas they remain bounded in the vertical. Vertical travel-time sensitivity kernels (VTSKs)-one-dimensional kernels describing the effect of horizontally uniform sound-speed changes on travel-times-are calculated analytically using a perturbation approach, and also numerically, as horizontal marginals of the corresponding TSKs. Good agreement between analytical and numerical VTSKs, as well as between 2D and 3D VTSKs, is found. As an alternative method to obtain wave-theoretic sensitivity kernels, the parabolic approximation is used; the resulting TSKs and VTSKs are in good agreement with normal-mode results.

Recent observations by Macrander et al. document a significant drop in the intensity of outflowing Denmark Strait Overflow Water of more than 20\% over 3 yr and a simultaneous increase in the temperature of the bottom layers of more than 0.4°C. A simulation of the exchange across the GISR with a regional ocean circulation model is used here to identify possible mechanisms that control changes in the Denmark Strait overflow and its relations to changed forcing condition. On seasonal and longer time scales, the authors establish links of the overflow anomalies to a decreasing capacity of the dense water reservoir caused by a change of circulation pattern north of the sill. On annual and shorter time scales, the wind stress curt around Iceland determines the barotropic circulation around the island and thus the barotropic flow through Denmark Strait. For the overlapping time scales, the barotropic and overflow component interactively determine transport variations. Last, a relation between sea surface height and reservoir height changes upstream of the sill is used to predict the overflow variability from altimeter data. Estimated changes are in agreement with other recent transport estimates based on current-meter arrays. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {The motion of sound ray trajectories in deep ocean environments, including internal wave induced scattering, is considered. Using the empirical Garrett-Munk internal wave spectrum and results from the study of stochastic differential equations, a framework for studying and modeling stochastic ray motion is developed. It is argued that terms in the ray equations involving internal wave induced sound speed perturbations δc can be neglected, but those involving δδc/δz cannot. It is then shown in that the (Markov) approximation that spatial variations of δδc/δz are delta correlated is remarkably good. These results lead naturally to an extremely simple system of coupled stochastic ray equations (in ray depth z, ray slowness p and travel time T) in which stochasticity enters the system only through the equation for p. Solutions to the stochastic ray equations - or the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation - describe approximately the density of acoustic energy in range, depth, angle and time. Two dimensionless parameters are introduced: (1) an acoustic Peclet number which is a measure of the ratio of the strength of deterministic ray refraction to that of stochastic scattering induced ray diffusion; and (2) a measure of the ratio of the strength of scattering induced ray diffusion to that of wave diffraction. Numerical solutions to the stochastic ray equations are compared to full wave simulations. These results show that, even in the weak scattering regime (large acoustic Peclet number), the inclusion of internal wave induced scattering may lead to important qualitative corrections to predictions of distributions of acoustic energy.},

  abstract = {The envelope of the time-lagged cross-correlation of an underwater noise field between two hydrophones can under certain conditions be used as a proxy for active acoustic receptions between the two locations enabling the study of ocean variability. Previous work looked at the sensitivity of cross-correlation peak amplitudes with respect to the distribution of the noise sources. The present study examines the sensitivity of the cross-correlation envelope peak times with respect to changes in the sound-speed distribution. A wave-theoretic scheme allowing for finite-frequency calculations in two and three dimensions, combined with the Born approximation for perturbations of the Green's function and the peak arrival approach, is used to obtain sensitivity kernels with respect to environmental (sound-speed) changes. These kernels provide a way to infer ocean structure from the cross-correlation peaks, considered as observables on their own and valid even in cases where the cross-correlation function does not approximate the time-domain Green's function between the two receivers. The sensitivity behavior is studied for different propagation conditions and noise-source distributions, ranging from spatially distributed uncorrelated noise sources to point sources, such as individual ships. Deviations from linearity are addressed and discussed.},

  abstract   = {Operational oceanography can be described as the provision of routine oceanographic information needed for decision-making purposes. It is dependent upon sustained research and development through the end-to-end framework of an operational service, from observation collection to delivery mechanisms. The core components of operational oceanographic systems are a multi-platform observation network, a data management system, a data assimilative prediction system, and a dissemination/accessibility system. These are interdependent, necessitating communication and exchange between them, and together provide the mechanism through which a clear picture of ocean conditions, in the past, present, and future, can be seen. Ocean observations play a critical role in all aspects of operational oceanography, not only for assimilation but as part of the research cycle, and for verification and validation of products. Data assimilative prediction systems are advancing at a fast pace, in tandem with improved science and the growth in computing power. To make best use of the system capability these advances would be matched by equivalent advances in operational observation coverage. This synergy between the prediction and observation systems underpins the quality of products available to stakeholders, and justifies the need for sustained ocean observations. In this white paper, the components of an operational oceanographic system are described, highlighting the critical role of ocean observations, and how the operational systems will evolve over the next decade to improve the characterization of ocean conditions, including at finer spatial and temporal scales.},

Major features of the Arctic and the interconnected nature of its wind- and buoyancy-driven circulation are reviewed here by presenting a synthesis of observational data interpreted from the perspective of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD). The general circulation is seen to be the superposition of Atlantic Water flowing into and around the Arctic basin and the two main wind-driven circulation features of the interior stratified Arctic Ocean: the Transpolar Drift Stream and the Beaufort Gyre. The specific drivers of these systems, including wind forcing, ice-ocean interactions, and surface buoyancy fluxes, and their associated GFD are explored. The essential understanding guides an assessment of how Arctic Ocean structure and dynamics might fundamentally change as the Arctic warms, sea-ice cover declines, and the ice that remains becomes more mobile.},

  abstract = {Passive acoustic data collection has grown exponentially over the past decade resulting in petabytes of data that document our ocean soundscapes. This effort has resulted in two Big Data challenges: 1) the curation, management, and global dissemination of passive acoustic datasets, and 2) efficiently extracting critical information and comparing it to other datasets in the context of ecosystem-based research and management. To address the former, the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information recently established an archive for passive acoustic data. This fast-growing archive currently contains over 100 TB of passive acoustic audio files mainly collected from stationary recorders. These datasets are documented with standards-based metadata and are freely available to the public. To begin to address the latter, through standardized processing and centralized stewardship and access, we provide a previously unattainable comparison of first order sound level-patterns from archived data collected across three distinctly separate long-term passive acoustic monitoring efforts conducted at regional and national scales: NOAA/National Park Service Ocean Noise Reference Station Network, the Atlantic Deepwater Ecosystem Observatory Network, and the Sanctuary Soundscape Monitoring Project. Nine sites were selected from these projects covering the Alaskan Arctic, Northeast and Central Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Mid and Northwest Atlantic. Sites could generally be categorized into those strongly influenced by anthropogenic noise (e.g., vessel traffic) and those that were not. Higher sound levels, specifically for lower frequencies ({\textless}125 Hz), and proximity to densely populated coastal zones were common characteristics of sites influenced by anthropogenic noise. Conversely, sites with lower overall sound levels and away from dense populations resulted in soundscape patterns influenced by biological sources. Seasonal variability in sound levels across selected decidecade bands was apparent for most sites and often represented changes in the presence or behavior of sound-producing species. This first order examination of levels across projects highlights the utility of these initial metrics to identify patterns that can then be examined in more detail. Finally, to help the passive acoustic monitoring community collectively and collaboratively move forward, we propose the next frontier for scalable data stewardship, access, and processing flow.},

  abstract   = {The deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer is an ecologically important feature of the open ocean. The DCM cannot be observed using aerial or satellite remote sensing; thus, in situ observations are essential. Further, understanding the responses of microbes to the environmental processes driving their metabolism and interactions requires observing in a reference frame that moves with a plankton population drifting in ocean currents, i.e., Lagrangian. Here, we report the development and application of a system of coordinated robots for studying planktonic biological communities drifting within the ocean. The presented Lagrangian system uses three coordinated autonomous robotic platforms. The focal platform consists of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) fitted with a robotic water sampler. This platform localizes and drifts within a DCM community, periodically acquiring samples while continuously monitoring the local environment. The second platform is an AUV equipped with environmental sensing and acoustic tracking capabilities. This platform characterizes environmental conditions by tracking the focal platform and vertically profiling in its vicinity. The third platform is an autonomous surface vehicle equipped with satellite communications and subsea acoustic tracking capabilities. While also acoustically tracking the focal platform, this vehicle serves as a communication relay that connects the subsea robot to human operators, thereby providing situational awareness and enabling intervention if needed. Deployed in the North Pacific Ocean within the core of a cyclonic eddy, this coordinated system autonomously captured fundamental characteristics of the in situ DCM microbial community in a manner not possible previously.},

What are the implications of this change for the social relations of oceanographic science? This paper contributes to efforts to address this question, pursuing a situated view of ocean sensing technologies so as to contextualize and analyze new representations of the sea, and interactions between individual scientists, technologies and the ocean. By taking a broad view on oceanography through a 50-year shift from ship-based to remote and robotic sensing, I show the ways in which new technologies may provide an opportunity to fight what Oreskes has called ‘ideologies of scientific heroism’. In particular, new sensing relations may emphasize the contributions of women and scientists from less well-funded institutions, as well as the ways in which oceanographic knowledge is always partial and dependent on interactions between nonhuman animals, technologies, and different humans. Thus, I argue that remote and robotic sensing technologies do not simply create more abstracted relations between scientists and the sea, but also may provide opportunities for more equitable scientific practice and refigured sensing relations.},

Many studies have been conducted on sound propagation in different parts of the oceans with different environments and, in this paper, the range and width of CZ is analyzed in the East Indian Ocean (EIO) and the South China Sea (SCS). Through the experimental data collected in different seasons with the propagation conditions change in the EIO and the SCS, we observe that the SSPs in different marine environments have a significant impact on the CZs of deep water. The sound channel mixing layer and isothermal layer have great effect on the CZ ranges. The water depths in the two experimental areas are similar, the range of the first CZ in the EIO is 7–8 km farther than that in the SCS, and the width of the CZs in the EIO is about 2–3 km narrower than that in the SCS. The surface mixed layer and the thermocline affect the CZ width but has little effect on the CZ range when the sound speed at the source and the bottom are practically the same. As the propagation conditions change along the seasons in the EIO, the range of the first CZ is almost the same, but the width of the CZs in the summer is about 2 km narrower than that in the spring. The water depth affects the CZ width but has little effect on the CZ range if the CZs can be formed. The different CZ characteristics between EIO and SCS are explained by both theoretical calculation and numerical simulation. The influence of the SSP structure and water depth on the CZ range are analyzed and the corresponding mechanism is explained. The research results are of great significance for underwater acoustic detection in deep sea.},

  abstract = {We propose a new copula model that can be used with replicated spatial data. Unlike the multivariate normal copula, the proposed copula is based on the assumption that a common factor exists and affects the joint dependence of all measurements of the process. Moreover, the proposed copula can model tail dependence and tail asymmetry. The model is parameterized in terms of a covariance function that may be chosen from the many models proposed in the literature, such as the Matérn model. For some choice of common factors, the joint copula density is given in closed form and therefore likelihood estimation is very fast. In the general case, one-dimensional numerical integration is needed to calculate the likelihood, but estimation is still reasonably fast even with large datasets. We use simulation studies to show the wide range of dependence structures that can be generated by the proposed model with different choices of common factors. We apply the proposed model to spatial temperature data and compare its performance with some popular geostatistics models. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In this work, both the sending vehicle and receiving vehicle or human operator are equipped with a shared real-time simulation of the sender's state based on the prior transmitted positions. Thus, only the innovation between the sender's actual state and the shared state need be sent over the link, such as a very low throughput acoustic modem. The distribution of this innovation can be modeled a priori or assembled adaptively. This distribution is then paired with an arithmetic entropy encoder, producing a very low cost representation of the vehicle's position vector. This system was analyzed on experimental data from the GLINT10 and AGAVE07 expeditions involving two different classes of AUVs performing a diverse number of maneuvers, and implemented on a fielded vehicle in the MBAT12 experiment. Using an adaptive probability distribution in combination with either of two state observer models, greater than 90\% compression, relative to a 32-b integer baseline, was achieved. © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

In regions such as these where there are quantifiable physical, chemical, or biological changes in the ocean environment, it is possible - with the proper instrumentation - to track, or map, the front boundary. In this paper, the front is approximated as an isotherm that is tracked autonomously and adaptively in 2D (horizontal) and 3D space by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) running MOOS-IvP autonomy. The basic, 2D (constant depth) front tracking method developed in this work has three phases: detection, classification, and tracking, and results in the AUV tracing a zigzag path along and across the front. The 3D AUV front tracking method presented here results in a helical motion around a central axis that is aligned along the front in the horizontal plane, tracing a 3D path that resembles a slinky stretched out along the front. To test and evaluate these front tracking methods (implemented as autonomy behaviors), virtual experiments were conducted with simulated AUVs in a spatiotemporally dynamic MIT MSEAS ocean model environment of the Mid-Atlantic Bight region, where a distinct temperature front is present along the shelfbreak. A number of performance metrics were developed to evaluate the performance of the AUVs running these front tracking behaviors, and the results are presented herein.},

The observed horizontal gradients in density are dynamically important in that they are associated with restratification of the surface ocean when dense water flows under light water. Such restratification is prevalent in wintertime and competes with convective mixing upon buoyancy forcing (e.g., ice growth and brine rejection) and shear-driven mixing when the ice moves relative to the ocean. Frontal structure and estimates of the balanced Richardson number point to the likelihood of dynamical restratification by isopycnal tilt and submesoscale baroclinic instability. Based on the evidence here, it is likely that submesoscale processes play an important role in setting surface-layer properties and lateral density variability in the Arctic Ocean. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

To combat this, university policy must focus on changing outdated attitudes about what it means to be a scientist (for ex., an 80-hour work week with a wife at home), and there should be an administrative body that has oversight to make sure goals are met.},

The study revealed that men and women's GRE V scores were not significantly different, but their GRE Q scores were. The study also tested for correlations between GRE V/Q scores and students that left the PhD after one year, students that left the PhD later in the program, and time to PhD completion. GRE scores did not correlate with time to degree or indicate students who left in the first year of the program. Remarkably, men who left their PhD programs had significantly higher GRE Q scores than men who stayed. The authors suggest that the GRE is a poor indicator of success in a PhD program.},

  abstract = {This report describes a new, flexible computer code in the FORTRAN computer language to make ray calculations for ocean acoustic tomography. The Numerical Recipes software package provided the basis for much of this computer code. The ray equations are reviewed, and ray equations that include the effects of ocean current are derived. Methods are derived for rapidly integrating those equations to obtain time front and eigenray information for long-range, deep-water acoustic transmissions. These methods include a look-up table for sound speed, sound speed gradient, second derivative of sound speed, and range-dependent information. Cubic spline methods are used to interpolate sound speed with depth and to obtain the derivatives of sound speed. The choice of the step size increments used to integrate the equations is a critical aspect of the integration, affecting both the accuracy of the prediction and the speed of computation. A predetermined, user-specified step size appears to allow more efficient calculations than "adaptive step" methods. "Adaptive step" methods adjust the step size automatically to maintain a given accuracy in the integration of the ray equations, while user-specified step sizes allow one to use prior knowledge of the integration problem to achieve the desired accuracy with much less computational overhead. Several integration methods were explored, but the classical 4th order Runge-Kutta method appears to be the most efficient and best method for this integration problem. Appendices describe detailed aspects of the computer code, as well as the methods used for deriving eigenray information and for parallelizing the ray calculations. The computer code is designed to be unstable so that the user can easily modify it to his or her own porpoises.},

The seasonal signal is characterized by enhanced values of volume, heat, and freshwater transport during the summer months associated with the presence of two summertime Pacific water masses, Alaskan Coastal Water and Chukchi Summer Water. Strikingly, over the decade the volume transport of the current has decreased by more than 80\%, with comparable reductions in the heat and freshwater transports, despite the fact that the flow through Bering Strait has increased over this time period. The largest changes in the boundary current have occurred in the summer months. Using atmospheric reanalysis fields and weather station data, we demonstrate that an increase in summer easterly winds along the Beaufort slope is the primary cause for the reduction in transport. The stronger winds are due to an intensification of the summer Beaufort High and deepening of the summer Aleutian Low. Using additional mooring and shipboard data in conjunction with satellite fields, we investigate the implications of the reduction in transport of the boundary current. We argue that a significant portion of the mass and heat passing through Bering Strait in recent years has been advected out of Barrow Canyon into the interior Canada Basin - rather than entering the boundary current in the Beaufort Sea - where it is responsible for a significant portion of the increased sea ice melt in the basin.},

  abstract = {In March and April 2010, an International Submarine Engineering (ISE) Explorer Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), built for Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), was deployed to Canadas High Arctic. Its mission was to undertake under-ice bathymetric surveys in support of Canada's United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Outer Continental Shelf claim. During this deployment several under-ice records were broken and several new technologies were demonstrated. This achievement was in part the result of the development work that ISE and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) undertook from 1993 to 1996 on the Theseus AUV during the Spinnaker program. During this program Theseus successfully completed two 200 km under-ice missions from CFS Alert on Ellesmere Island. NRCans AUV is an ISE Explorer class vehicle, with several innovative additions to make it suitable for Arctic survey work. Most notable are a 4000 m depth rated variable ballast system, a 1500 Hz long range homing system, and under ice charging and data transfer capabilities. A Short Range Localization (SRL) system was also developed for close range positioning. The homing and SRL systems were developed by Canadian defense scientists and engineers at DRDC. The Explorers range was extended to approximately 400 km by adding an additional hull section to accommodate extra batteries. The Main Camp near Borden Island (7813.50'N, 11238.87'W) was the launch site for the AUV. It was launched from an 8 m by 2.5 m ice-hole, cut through 2 - 3 m of thick ice. After several test dives its first mission was a transit to a Remote Camp, over 300 km to the northwest. The AUV autonomously homed into the Remote Camp and was successfully docked at the ice-hole where, without being removed from the water, it was charged and survey data was downloaded, all through a 1.5 m square ice hole. Subsequently, a second survey mission greater than 300 km in round trip length was undertaken, after which the AUV returned back to the Remote Camp. Finally, the vehicle embarked on a return mission to the Main Camp for recovery. From beginning to end, the AUV spent nearly 12 days under the ice before being successfully recovered. In total, close to 1000 km of under ice survey was accomplished between the AUV launch, Remote Camp mission, and recovery. The AUV reached depths of 3160 m and transited at an average speed of 1.5 m/s at an altitude of 130 m off the seabed. ISE and DRDC are now preparing for a 2011 deployment to collect additional data UNCLOS data. Aspects of the pre-deployment that will be presented include fail-safe provisions, mission planning, risk assessment, and mission logistics. Operational aspects to be discussed will include dealing with AUV operations in the extreme cold, initialization of the inertial navigation system, under-ice acoustics, acoustic homing to the recovery site and the procedures for recovery. © 2010 IEEE.},

Samples collected from within the plume reveal monoaromatic petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in excess of 50 micrograms per liter. These data indicate that monoaromatic input to this plume was at least 5500 kilograms per day, which is more than double the total source rate of all natural seeps of the monoaromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Dissolved oxygen concentrations suggest that microbial respiration rates within the plume were not appreciably more than 1 micromolar oxygen per day.},

The review finds that FG students tend to be “disadvantaged in the admission process, under-prepared once on campus, and less likely to graduate”. Attending university can also create a cultural rift between FG students and their families, and these issues are only heightened if the student decides to attend a graduate program (which disproportionately few do). Beyond the PhD, there is little research about FG professionals and their academic careers. However, there is reason to believe that the disadvantages they faced in the beginning could follow them throughout their careers.

The study area was an 80 × 70 km grid east of Bear Island where the front exhibits topographic trapping along the northern slope of the Bear Island Trough. Conductivity-temperature-depth, current meter, and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data, combined with tomographic cross sections, presented a highly resolved picture of the front in August. All hydrographic measurements were dominated by tidal signals, with the strongest signatures associated with the M2 and S2 semidiurnal species. Mean currents in the warm saline water to the south of the front, derived from a current meter mooring and ADCP data, were directed to the southwest and may be associated with a barotropic recirculation of Norwegian Atlantic Water (NAW) within the Bear Island Trough. The geostrophic component of the velocity was well correlated with the measured southwestward mean surface layer flow north of the front. The frontal structure was retrograde, as the frontal isopleths sloped opposite to the bathymetry. The surface signature of the front was dominated by salinity gradients associated with the confluence of Atlantic and Arctic water masses, both warmed by insolation to a depth of about 20 m. The surface manifestation of the front varied laterally on the order of 10 km associated with tidal oscillations. Below the mixed layer, temperature and salinity variations were compensating, defining a nearly barotropic front. The horizontal scale of the front in this region was ∼3 km or less. At middepth beneath the frontal interface, tomographic cross sections indicated a high-frequency (∼16 cpd) upslope motion of filaments of NAW origin. The summertime BSPF was confirmed to have many of the general characteristics of a shelf-slope frontal system [Mooers et al., 1978] as well as a topographic-circulatory front [Federov, 1983].

  abstract = {Systems capable of forecasting ocean properties and acoustic performance in the littoral ocean are becoming a useful capability for scientific and operational exercises. The coupling of a data-assimilative nested ocean modeling system with an acoustic propagation modeling system was carried out at sea for the first time, within the scope of Battlespace Preparation 2007 (BP07) that was part of Marine Rapid Environmental Assessment (MREA07) exercises. The littoral region for our studies was southeast of the island of Elba ( Italy) in the Tyrrhenian basin east of Corsica and Sardinia. During BP07, several vessels collected in situ ocean data,. based in part on recommendations from oceanographic forecasts. The data were assimilated into a fourdimensional high-resolution ocean modeling system. Sound-speed forecasts were then used as inputs for bearing- and range-dependent acoustic propagation forecasts. Data analyses are carried out and the set-up of the coupled oceanographic-acoustic system as well as the results of its real-time use are described. A significant finding is that oceanographic variability can considerably influence acoustic propagation properties, including the probability of detection, even in this apparently quiet region around Elba. This strengthens the importance of coupling at-sea acoustic modeling to real-time ocean forecasting. Other findings include the challenges involved in downscaling basin-scale modeling systems to high-resolution littoral models, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to natural changes, global human activities and present model resolutions, the assimilation of synoptic regional ocean data is recommended in the region. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The underwater sounds of glaciers are a powerful remote sensing tool for monitoring changing conditions in polar regions. Introduction and Motivation The stability of major ice sheets in polar regions are linked to sea level rise and the input of fresh meltwater into sensitive regions of the thermohaline circulation system (the oceanic salt and heat conveyor belt), two critical issues related to global change. Estimates of the future contributions to sea level rise from the melting of glaciers in Greenland alone range from 0.3 m to 3 m for the year 2100 (Berwyn, 2018). Moreover, the recent acceleration of mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), which quadrupled from 1992-2001 to 2002-2011 (Figure 1), led to a global mean sea level rise of 7-8 mm between 1992 and 2011 (Shepherd et al., 2012). Global glacier melt (small glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets) currently contributes almost 1 mm/yr to the total sea level rise (Zemp et al., 2019). In addition to contributing to sea level rise, the freshening of surface waters affects global-scale heat transport by weakening the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Bamber et al., 2012). For these and other reasons, understanding the mass loss of glaciers is an important problem.},

  abstract = {Passive acoustic tracking provides an unobtrusive method of studying the movement of sound-producing animals in the marine environment where traditional tracking methods may be costly or infeasible. We used passive acoustic tracking to characterize the fine-scale movements of singing humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground. Male humpback whales produce complex songs, a phenomenon that is well documented in tropical regions during the winter breeding season, but also occurs at higher latitudes during other times of year. Acoustic recordings were made throughout 2009 using an array of autonomous recording units deployed in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Song was recorded during spring and fall, and individual singing whales were localized and tracked throughout the array using a correlation sum estimation method on the time-synchronized recordings. Tracks were constructed for forty-three song sessions, revealing a high level of variation in movement patterns in both the spring and fall seasons, ranging from slow meandering to faster directional movement. Tracks were 30 min to 8 h in duration, and singers traveled distances ranging from 0.9 to 20.1 km. Mean swimming speed was 2.06 km/h (SD 0.95). Patterns and rates of movement indicated that most singers were actively swimming. In one case, two singers were tracked simultaneously, revealing a potential acoustic interaction. Our results provide a first description of the movements of singers on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground, and demonstrate the utility of passive acoustic tracking for studying the fine-scale movements of cetaceans within the behavioral context of their calls. These methods have further applications for conservation and management purposes, particularly by enhancing our ability to estimate cetacean densities using passive acoustic monitoring.},

We survey the recent advances and transformative potential of machine learning (ML), including deep learning, in the field of acoustics. ML is a broad family of techniques, which are often based in statistics, for automatically detecting and utilizing patterns in data. Relative to conventional acoustics and signal processing, ML is data-driven. Given sufficient training data, ML can discover complex relationships between features and desired labels or actions, or between features themselves. With large volumes of training data, ML can discover models describing complex acoustic phenomena such as human speech and reverberation. ML in acoustics is rapidly developing with compelling results and significant future promise. We first introduce ML, then highlight ML developments in four acoustics research areas: source localization in speech processing, source localization in ocean acoustics, bioacoustics, and environmental sounds in everyday scenes.},

This study seeks to quantify the annual cycle of the thermohaline structure in the Beaufort Sea and characterize acoustically relevant oceanographic processes such as eddies, internal waves, near-inertial waves (NIWs), and spice. The observations are from a seven-mooring, 150-km radius acoustic transceiver array equipped with oceanographic sensors that collected data in the Beaufort Sea from 2016 to 2017. Depth and time variations of the sound speed are analyzed using isopycnal displacements, allowing a separation of baroclinic processes and spice. Compared to lower latitudes, the overall sound speed variability is small with a maximum root mean square of 0.6 m/s. The largest source of variability is spice, most significant in the upper 100 m, followed by eddies and internal waves. The displacement spectrum in the internal wave band is time dependent and different from the Garret-Munk (GM) spectrum. The internal wave energy varied with time averaging 5\% of the GM spectrum. The spice sound-speed frequency spectrum has a form very different from the displacement spectrum, a result not seen at lower latitudes. Because sound speed variations are weak, observations of episodic energetic NIWs with horizontal currents up to 20 cm/s have potential acoustical consequences.},

This activity will be driven by increased demand for energy and the marine resources of an Arctic Ocean accessible to ships. Oil and gas exploration, fisheries, mineral extraction, marine transportation, research and development, tourism, and search and rescue will increase the pressure on the vulnerable Arctic environment. Technologies that allow synoptic in situ observations year-round are needed to monitor and forecast changes in the Arctic atmosphere-ice-ocean system at daily, seasonal, annual, and decadal scales. These data can inform and enable both sustainable development and enforcement of international Arctic agreements and treaties, while protecting this critical environment. In this paper, we discuss multipurpose acoustic networks, including subsea cable components, in the Arctic. These networks provide communication, power, underwater and under-ice navigation, passive monitoring of ambient sound (ice, seismic, biologic, and anthropogenic), and acoustic remote sensing (tomography and thermometry), supporting and complementing data collection from platforms, moorings, and vehicles. We support the development and implementation of regional to basin-wide acoustic networks as an integral component of a multidisciplinary in situ Arctic Ocean observatory.},

Sci. 49, 97-106 (1992); Stanton et al., ICES J. Mar. Sci. 51, 505- 512 (1994)]. Based mainly on the spectral information, scattering models have been proposed to describe the backscattering mechanisms of different zooplankton groups [Stanton et al., J. Acoust. Sec. Am. 103, 236-253 (1998b)]. In this paper, an in-depth study of pulse compression (PC) techniques is presented to characterize the temporal, spectral, and statistical signatures of the acoustic backscattering by zooplankton of different gross anatomical classes. Data collected from various sources are analyzed and the results are consistent with our acoustic models. From compressed pulse (CP) outputs for all three different zooplankton groups, two major arrivals from different parts of the animal body can be identified: a primary and a secondary arrival. (1) Shrimplike animals (Euphausiids and decapod shrimp; near broadside incidence only): the primary one is from the front interface (interface closest to the transducer) of the animal and the secondary arrival is from the back interface; (2) gas-bearing animals (Siphonophores): the primary arrival is from the gas inclusion and the secondary arrival is from the body tissue (''local acoustic center of mass''); and (3) elastic shelled animals (Gastropods): the primary one is from the front interface and the secondary arrival corresponds to the subsonic Lamb wave that circumnavigates the surface of the shell. Statistical analysis of these arrivals is used to successfully infer the size of the individual animals. In conjunction with different aspects of PC techniques explored in this paper, a concept of partial wave target strength (PWTS) is introduced to describe scattering by the different CP highlights. Furthermore, temporal gating of the CP output allows rejection of unwanted signals, improves the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spectra of selected partial waves of interest, and provides a better understanding of the scattering mechanism of the animals. In addition, it is found that the averaged PWTS can be used to obtain a more quantitative scattering characterization for certain animals such as siphonophores.

The array consisted of 128 hydrophones arranged in a comblike configuration (4x32 vertical linear arrays). A moored pinger, 9 km from the arrays, transmitted signals with a 1 minute repetition rate. The study of the influence of fluctuations in the water column (typically internal waves, very frequent in shallow waters and coastal environments) on sound waves propagation is aimed. To do so, fluctuations of the received wavefronts at various frequencies (from 1kHz to 13kHz) on each of the four joint vertical linear arrays are shown. Statistics of the recorded data are also provided, including Mutual Coherence Function (MCF), radius of coherence and array gain degradation. The non-stationarity and non-uniformity of the received data highlights the influence of spatio-temporal variations of the medium. In complement, CTD casts were performed at various times at the source and receiver locations. A CTD chain was deployed next to the receiving array so that environmental fluctuations are monitored during the campaign whole duration. The presence of a strong thermocline is shown by the data analysis.},

Individual layers in the staircase are of order 1 m in vertical height but appear to extend horizontally for hundreds of kilometers, with along-layer gradients of temperature and salinity tightly related. On the basis of laboratory-derived double-diffusive flux laws, estimated vertical heat fluxes through the staircase are in the range 0.05–0.3Wm?2, only about one tenth of the estimated mean surface mixed layer heat flux to the sea ice. It is thus concluded that the vertical transport of heat from the Atlantic Water in the central basin is unlikely to have a significant impact to the Canada Basin ocean surface heat budget. Icebreaker conductivity-temperature-depth data from the Beaufort Gyre Freshwater Experiment show that the staircase is absent at the basin periphery. Turbulent mixing that presumably disrupts the staircase might drive greater flux from the Atlantic Water at the basin boundaries and possibly dominate the regionally averaged heat flux.},

Typically, there are only a few sources when compared to the number of candidate source locations or range-depth cells. We use sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) to learn a common sparsity profile corresponding to the location of present sources. SBL performance is compared to traditional processing in simulations and using experimental ocean acoustic data. Specifically, we localize a quiet source in the presence of a surface interferer in a shallow water environment. This multi-frequency scenario requires adaptive processing and includes modest environmental and sensor position mismatch in the MFP model. The noise process changes likely with time and is modeled as a non-stationary Gaussian process, meaning that the noise variance changes across snapshots. The adaptive SBL algorithm models the complex source amplitudes as random quantities, providing robustness to amplitude and phase errors in the model. This is demonstrated with experimental data, where SBL exhibits improved source localization performance when compared to the white noise gain constraint (-3 dB) and Bartlett processors.},

  abstract  = {Doppler Velocity Logs (DVLs) are devices that have considerable and widespread use in maritime applications. They can be used to provide velocity information, with respect to the sea floor, about the vehicle on which they are mounted. The principle which they use to provide this information is, as their name suggests, the Doppler shifting of acoustic signals. This paper seeks to describe the potential accuracy of a DVL as a function of both design and environmental parameters. It takes a two-stage approach in doing so. The first stage is to find the accuracy of a single acoustic beam based on some particular method (in this case: Non-Linear Least Squares parameter estimation). The second step is to find the resulting accuracy of a multi-beam DVL based on the results acquired in the first step. This paper serves as a precursor to designing and building a "DIY" DVL. It's intent is to provide information about some of the design decisions required to achieve a certain accuracy. The paper's methods are more or less independent of the specific methods used in industry, as that information is largely proprietary. The paper is divided in to three parts. The first part is an introduction to the use, capabilities, and functionality of DVLs. The second part concerns the accuracy and simulation of a single acoustic beam of a DVL. The third part discusses the accuracy of a full multibeam configuration as a function of the second. © 2012 IEEE.},

The towed system contains broadband acoustic channels collectively spanning the frequency range 1.7-100 kHz, with some gaps. Using a pulse-compression technique, the range resolution of the echoes is ∼20 and 3 cm in the lower and upper ranges of the frequencies, respectively, allowing high-resolution imaging of patches and resolving fish near the seafloor. Measuring the swimbladder resonance at the lower frequencies eliminates major ambiguities normally associated with the interpretation of fish echo data: (i) the resonance frequency can be used to estimate the volume of the swimbladder (inferring the size of fish), and (ii) signals at the lower frequencies do not depend strongly on the orientation of the fish. At-sea studies of Atlantic herring demonstrate the potential for routine measurements of fish size and density, with significant improvements in accuracy over traditional high-frequency narrowband echosounders. The system also detected patches of scatterers, presumably zooplankton, at the higher frequencies. New techniques for quantitative use of broadband systems are presented, including broadband calibration and relating target strength and volume-scattering strength to quantities associated with broadband signal processing.},

  abstract = {During naval operations, sonar performance estimates often need to be computed in-situ with limited environmental information. This calls for the use of fast acoustic propagation models. Many naval operations are carried out in challenging and dynamic environments. This makes acoustic propagation and sonar performance behavior particularly complex and variable, and complicates prediction. Using data from a field experiment, we have investigated the accuracy with which acoustic propagation loss (PL) can be predicted, using only limited modeling capabilities. Environmental input parameters came from various sources that may be available in a typical naval operation. The outer continental shelf shallow-water experimental area featured internal tides, packets of nonlinear internal waves, and a meandering water mass front. For a moored source/receiver pair separated by 19.6 km, the acoustic propagation loss for 800 Hz pulses was computed using the peak amplitude. The variations in sound speed translated into considerable PL variability of order 15 dB. Acoustic loss modeling was carried out using a data-driven regional ocean model as well as measured sound speed profile data for comparison. The acoustic model used a two-dimensional parabolic approximation (vertical and radial outward wavenumbers only). The variance of modeled propagation loss was less than that measured. The effect of the internal tides and sub-tidal features was reasonably well modeled; these made use of measured sound speed data. The effects of nonlinear waves were not well modeled, consistent with their known three-dimensional effects but also with the lack of measurements to initialize and constrain them. © 2013 IEEE.},

In contrast, measurements in an energetic estuarine shear zone reveal that the mixing induced by shear instability at high Reynolds number does not primarily occur by overturning in the cores; rather it results from secondary shear instabilities within the zones of intensified shear separating the cores. This regime is not likely to be observed in the relatively low Reynolds number flows of the laboratory or in direct numerical simulations, but it is likely a common occurrence in the ocean and tmosphere.

  abstract = {This paper describes the development and experimental results of navigation algorithms for an autonomous underwater glider (AUG) that uses an on-board acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). AUGs are buoyancy-driven autonomous underwater vehicles that use small hydrofoils to make forward progress while profiling vertically. During each dive, which can last up to 6 hours, the Seaglider AUG used in this experiment typically reaches the depth of 1000 m and travels 3-6 km horizontally through the water, relying solely on dead-reckoning. Horizontal through-the-water (TTW) progress of AUG is 20-30 cm/s, which is comparable to the speed of the stronger ocean currents. Underwater navigation of an AUG in the presence of unknown advection therefore presents a considerable challenge. We develop two related formulations for post-processing. Both use ADCP observations, through the water velocity estimates, and GPS fixes to estimate current profiles. However, while the first solves an explicit inverse problem for the current profiles only, the second solves a deconvolution problem that infers both states and current profiles using a state-space model. Both approaches agree on their estimates of the ocean current profile through which the AUG was flown using measurements of current relative to the AUG from the ADCP, and estimates of the AUGs TTW velocity from a hydrodynamic model. The result is a complete current profile along the AUGs trajectory, as well as over-the-ground (OTG) velocities for the AUG that can be used for more accurate subsea positioning. Results are demonstrated using 1 MHz ADCP data collected from a Seaglider AUG deployed for 49 days off the north coast of Alaska during August and September 2017. The results are compared to ground truth data from the top 40 meters of the water column, from a moored, upward-facing 600 kHz ADCP. Consequences of the state-space formulation are discussed in the Conclusions section.},

A characteristic surface duct beneath the sea-ice in the Marginal Ice Zone causes acoustic waves to be trapped and continuously interact with the sea-ice. The reflectivity of the sea-ice depends on the thickness, the elastic properties, and its roughness. This work focuses on the influence of sea-ice roughness on long-range acoustic propagation, and on how well the arrival structure can be predicted by the full wave integration model OASES. In 2013, acoustic signals centered at 900 Hz were transmitted every hour for three days between ice-Tethered buoys in a drifting network in the Fram Strait. The experiment was set up to study the signal stability in the surface channel below the sea-ice. Oceanographic profiles were collected during the experiment, while a statistical description of the rough sea-ice was established based on historical ice-draft measurements. This environmental description is used as input to the range independent version of OASES. The model simulations correspond fairly well with the observations, despite that a flat bathymetry is used and the sea-ice roughness cannot be fully approximated by the statistical representation used in OASES. Long-range transmissions around 900 Hz are found to be more sensitive to the sea-ice roughness than the elastic parameters.},

Noise levels arising from the proposed activity are modelled and the potential impact on species of interest within the affected area is then evaluated. Although there is considerable uncertainty in the relationship between noise levels and impacts on aquatic species, the science underlying noise modelling is well understood. Nevertheless, many environmental impact assessments (EIAs) do not reflect best practice, and stakeholders and decision makers in the EIA process are often unfamiliar with the concepts and terminology that are integral to interpreting noise exposure predictions. In this paper, we review the process of underwater noise modelling and explore the factors affecting predictions of noise exposure. Finally, we illustrate the consequences of errors and uncertainties in noise modelling, and discuss future research needs to reduce uncertainty in noise assessments.},

Slocum Gliders have transitioned from a concept to a technology serving basic research and environmental stewardship. The long duration and low operating costs of Gliders allow them to anchor spatial time series. Large distances, over 600 km, can be covered using a single set of alkaline batteries. Since the initial tests, a wide range of physical and optical sensors have been integrated into the Glider allowing measurements of temperature, salinity, depth averaged currents, surface currents, fluorescence, apparent and inherent optical properties. A command/control center, entitled Dockserver, has been developed that allows users to fly fleets of gliders simultaneously in multiple places around the world via the Internet. Over the last 2.5 years, Rutgers Gliders have logged 27 056 kilometers, and flown 1357 days at sea. Gliders call into the automated Glider Command Center at the Rutgers campus via satellite phone to provide a status update, download data, and receive new mission commands. The ability to operate Gliders for extended periods of time are making them the central in situ technology for the evolving ocean observatories. Off shore New Jersey Gliders have occupied a cross shelf transect and have documented the annual variability in shelf wide stratification on the Mid-Atlantic Bight and the role of storms in sediment resuspension.

The area is located offshore Georgia (eastern part of the Black Sea) at a water depth between 840 m and 870 m. The sediment echosounder Parasound DS-3/P70 was used for detecting bubbles in the water column that causes strong backscatter in the echographs ("flares"). Employing the swath echsounder Kongsberg EM710 flares in the water column were mapped along the entire swath width of approximately 1000 m at high spatial resolution. The exact location of the flares could be extracted manually. Subsequently, the horizontally looking sonar Kongsberg digital telemetry MS1000 mounted on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was utilized to quantify the flux of bubbles. A model was developed that is based on the principle of finding the "acoustic mass" in order to quantify the bubble flux at various seeps. The acoustic approach from the backscatter data of the ROV sonar resulted in bubble fluxes in the range of 0.01 to 5.5 L/min (corresponding to 0.037 to 20.5 mol CH 4/min) at in situ conditions (̃850 m water depth, ̃9°C). Independent flux estimations using a funnel-shaped device showed that the acoustic model consistently produced lower values but the offset is less than 12\%. Furthermore, the deviation decreased with increasing flux rates. A field of bubble streams was scanned three times from different directions in order to reveal the reproducibility of the method. Flux estimations yielded consistent fluxes of about 2 l/min (7.4 mol CH4/min) with variations of less than 10\%. Although gas emissions have been found at many sites at the seafloor in a range of geological settings, the amount of escaping gas is still largely unknown. With this study presenting a novel method of quantifying bubble fluxes employing a horizontally looking sonar system, it is intended to contribute to the global effort of better constraining bubble fluxes at deep-sea settings. © 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Although such a sea ice loss was not indicated until much later in the century in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment Report, many models show an accelerating decline in the summer minimum sea ice extent during the 21st century. Using the observed 2007/2008 September sea ice extents as a starting point, we predict an expected value for a nearly sea ice free Arctic in September by the year 2037. The first quartile of the distribution for the timing of September sea ice loss will be reached by 2028. Our analysis is based on projections from six IPCC models, selected subject to an observational constraints. Uncertainty in the timing of a sea ice free Arctic in September is determined based on both within-model contributions from natural variability and between-model differences.

  abstract = {We derive conservative time-dependent structured discretizations and two-way embedded (nested) schemes for multiscale ocean dynamics governed by primitive equations (PEs) with a nonlinear free surface. Our multiscale goal is to resolve tidalto-mesoscale processes and interactions over large multiresolution telescoping domains with complex geometries including shallow seas with strong tides, steep shelfbreaks, and deep ocean interactions. We first provide an implicit time-stepping algorithm for the nonlinear free-surface PEs and then derive a consistent time-dependent spatial discretization with a generalized vertical grid. This leads to a novel timedependent finite volume formulation for structured grids on spherical or Cartesian coordinates, second order in time and space, which preserves mass and tracers in the presence of a time-varying free surface. We then introduce the concept of two-way nesting, implicit in space and time, which exchanges all of the updated fields values across grids, as soon as they become available. A class of such powerful nesting schemes applicable to telescoping grids of PE models with a nonlinear free surface is derived. The schemes mainly differ in the fine-to-coarse scale transfers and in the interpolations and numerical filtering, specifically for the barotropic velocity and surface pressure components of the two-way exchanges. Our scheme comparisons show that for nesting with free surfaces, the most accurate scheme has the strongest implicit couplings among grids. We complete a theoretical truncation error analysis to confirm and mathematically explain findings. Results of our discretizations and two-way nesting are presented in realistic multiscale simulations with data assimilation for the middle Atlantic Bight shelfbreak region off the east coast of the USA, the Philippine archipelago, and the Taiwan-Kuroshio region. Multiscale modeling with two-way nesting enables an easy use of different sub-gridscale parameterizations in each nested domain. The new developments drastically enhance the predictive capability and robustness of our predictions, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Without them, our multiscale multiprocess simulations either were not possible or did not match ocean data. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

Common practice is to approximate unknown positions by linearly interpolating latitude-longitude between known positions before and after ice cover, although it has been suggested that some improvement may be obtained by interpolating along contours of planetary-geostrophic potential vorticity. Profiles with linearly interpolated positions represent 16\% of the Southern Ocean Argo data set; consequences arising from this approximation have not been quantified. Using three distinct data sets from the Weddell Gyre—10-day satellite-tracked Argo floats, daily-tracked RAFOS-enabled floats, and a particle release simulation in the Southern Ocean State Estimate—we perform a data withholding experiment to assess position uncertainty in latitude-longitude and potential vorticity coordinates as a function of time since last fix. A spatial correlation analysis using the float data provides temperature and salinity uncertainty estimates as a function of distance error. Combining the spatial correlation scales and the position uncertainty, we estimate uncertainty in temperature and salinity as a function of duration of position loss. Maximum position uncertainty for interpolation during 8 months without position data is 116 ± 148 km for latitude-longitude and 92 ± 121 km for potential vorticity coordinates.

This is demonstrated using some hypothetical shallow water environments, and by comparing mode shapes at different frequencies. The formula is especially convenient to implement in normal mode computer codes which already perform similar calculations for mode normalization and attenuation coefficients. Using the WKB approximation to the normal mode functions, the formula is identified with the average horizontal speed of the ray equivalent to the mode. For a shallow water environment with bottom interaction, the group velocity formula is shown to include the beam and the time displacement effects of modified ray theory. This result strengthens the ray/mode analogy which is used in analyzing ocean acoustics problems.© 1983, Acoustical Society of America. All Rights Reserved},

The motivation is to obtain a filter that is applicable to realistic geophysical applications, but that also rigorously utilizes the governing dynamical equations with information theory and learning theory for efficient Bayesian data assimilation. Building on the foundations of classical filters, the underlying theory and algorithmic implementation of the new filter are developed and derived. The stochastic Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) field equations and their adaptive stochastic subspace are employed to predict prior probabilities for the full dynamical state, effectively approximating the Fokker-Planck equation. At assimilation times, the DO realizations are fit to semiparametric Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the Bayesian Information Criterion. Bayes's law is then efficiently carried out analytically within the evolving stochastic subspace. The resulting GMM-DO filter is illustrated in a very simple example. Variations of the GMM-DO filter are also provided along with comparisons with related schemes. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

Calibrated acoustic data ({\textless}1000 Hz) from an autonomous seafloor-mounted acoustic recorder were combined with ship passage information from the Automatic Identification System. This approach allowed for detailed measurements (i.e., source level, sound exposure level, and transmission range) on ships of opportunity. A key result was different acoustic levels and spectral shapes observed from different ship-types. A 54 kGT container ship had the highest broadband source level at 188 dB re 1 μPa@1m; a 26 kGT chemical tanker had the lowest at 177 dB re 1 μPa@1m. Bulk carriers had higher source levels near 100 Hz, while container ship and tanker noise was predominantly below 40 Hz. Simple models to predict source levels of modern merchant ships as a group from particular ship characteristics (e.g., length, gross tonnage, and speed) were not possible given individual ship-type differences. Furthermore, ship noise was observed to radiate asymmetrically. Stern aspect noise levels are 5 to 10 dB higher than bow aspect noise levels. Collectively, these results emphasize the importance of including modern ship-types in quantifying shipping noise for predictive models of global, regional, and local marine environments.},

  abstract = {Using a collection of 46 shipboard hydrographic/velocity transects occupied across the shelfbreak and slope of the Chukchi Sea between 2002 and 2014, we have quantified the existence of a current transporting Pacific-origin water westward over the upper continental slope. It has been named the Chukchi slope current, which is believed to emanate from Barrow Canyon. The current is surface-intensified, order 50 km wide, and advects both summer and winter waters. It is not trapped to a particular isobath, but instead is reminiscent of a free jet. There is no significant variation in Pacific water transport with distance from Barrow Canyon. A potential vorticity analysis suggests that the flow is baroclinically unstable, consistent with the notion that it meanders. The current is present during all synoptic wind conditions, but increases in strength from summer to fall presumably due to the seasonal enhancement of the easterly winds in the region. Its transport increased over the 12-year period of data coverage, also likely in response to wind forcing. In the mean, the slope current transports 0.50±0.07 Sv of Pacific water. This estimate allows us to construct a balanced mass budget of the Chukchi shelf inflows and outflows. Our study also confirms the existence of an eastward-flowing Chukchi shelfbreak jet transporting 0.10±0.03 Sv of Pacific water towards Barrow Canyon.},

The problem is examined here in the range independent case, with axial transmitters and receivers. After showing that moving the receiver by a few kilometers does not compromise the ray identification, an inversion is performed for both a fixed and a moving receiver. Allowing receiver displacements does not reduce the resolution significantly in the upper part of the ocean but does increase the sensitivity to noise. This sensitivity implies that for such experiments the measurement of the travel times must be very accurate. More efficient use of a priori knowledge of the ocean reduces this sensitivity by decreasing the number of degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {© 2021 Acoustical Society of America. Detecting acoustic transients by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) becomes problematic in nonstationary ambient noise environments characteristic of coral reefs. An alternate approach presented here uses signal directionality to automatically detect and localize transient impulsive sounds collected on underwater vector sensors spaced tens of meters apart. The procedure, which does not require precise time synchronization, first constructs time-frequency representations of both the squared acoustic pressure (spectrogram) and dominant directionality of the active intensity (azigram) on each sensor. Within each azigram, sets of time-frequency cells associated with transient energy arriving from a consistent azimuthal sector are identified. Binary image processing techniques then link sets that share similar duration and bandwidth between different sensors, after which the algorithm triangulates the source location. Unlike most passive acoustic detectors, the threshold criterion for this algorithm is bandwidth instead of pressure magnitude. Data collected from shallow coral reef environments demonstrate the algorithm's ability to detect SCUBA bubble plumes and consistent spatial distributions of somniferous fish activity. Analytical estimates and direct evaluations both yield false transient localization rates from 3\% to 6\% in a coral reef environment. The SNR distribution of localized pulses off Hawaii has a median of 7.7 dB and interquartile range of 7.1 dB.},

The primary goal of LCM is to simplify the development of low-latency message passing systems, especially for real-time robotics research applications. Messages can be transmitted between different processes using LCM's publish/subscribe message-passing system. A platform- and language-independent type specification language separates message description from implementation. Message specifications are automatically compiled into language-specific bindings, eliminating the need for users to implement marshalling code while guaranteeing run-time type safety. LCM is notable in providing a real-time deep traffic inspection tool that can decode and display message traffic with minimal user effort and no impact on overall system performance. This and other features emphasize LCM's focus on simplifying both the development and debugging of message passing systems.

During the evening of 30 October a narrow stream of high electron concentration plasma crossed the polar cap in the antisunward ionospheric convection. A GPS scintillation receiver in the European high arctic, operating at 1.575 GHz, experienced both phase and amplitude scintillation on several satellite-to-ground links during this period. Close examination of the GPS signals revealed the scintillation to be co-located with strong gradients in Total Electron Content (TEC) at the edge of the plasma stream. The gradient-drift instability is a likely mechanism for the generation of the irregularities causing some of the scintillation at L band frequencies during this storm. The origin of the high TEC is explored and the possible implications of the work for scintillation forecasting are noted. The results indicate that the GPS scintillation over Svalbard can originate from traceable ionospheric plasma structures convecting from the American sector.

  abstract = {An experiment validating the concept of acoustically focused oceanographic sampling (AFOS) was recently implemented in Haro Strait, British Columbia (Canada). Four 16-element vertical receiver arrays were moored around the location of a coastal front driven by estuarine and tidal forcing. Various signals were transmitted from array to array and from a moving source to the arrays over a period of five weeks. Tomographic signals were transmitted over a wide frequency band (150 Hz to 15 kHz). The novelty of the Haro Strait data set resides in its unusual tomographic features: ranges are short (less than 3 km), sound speed perturbations are small (2 to 3 m/s), and currents are relatively strong (3.5 kts). Light-bulb-generated wideband acoustic signals are used in this paper in conjunction with local nonacoustic measurements in order to image the three-dimensional sound speed and current fields within the water mass enclosed by the moored arrays. The combined use of integral and local data leads to a significant decrease of the field estimate uncertainty while maintaining a coverage of the area not achievable by nonacoustic means.},

The observed acoustic arrival patterns are unusual, however, consisting of a single, broad arrival pulse, with no discernible repeating patterns or individual ray arrivals. The nature of these arrivals is caused by vigorous acoustic scattering from the small-scale processes that dominate ocean variability in Fram Strait. Simple models for internal wave and mesoscale variability were constructed and tailored to match the variability observed by moored thermisters in Fram Strait. The internal wave contribution to variability is weak. Acoustic propagation through a simulated ocean consisting of a climatological sound speed plus mesoscale and internal wave scintillations obtains arrival patterns that match the characteristics of those observed, i.e., pulse width and travel time variation. The scintillations cause a proliferation of acoustic ray paths, however, reminiscent of "ray chaos." This understanding of the acoustic forward problem is prerequisite to designing an inverse scheme for estimating temperature from the observed travel times.},

  abstract = {The highly productive fisheries of Alaska are located in seas projected to experience strong global change, including rapid transitions in temperature and ocean acidification-driven changes in pH and other chemical parameters. Many of the marine organisms that are most intensely affected by ocean acidification (OA) contribute substantially to the state's commercial fisheries and traditional subsistence way of life. Prior studies of OA's potential impacts on human communities have focused only on possible direct economic losses from specific scenarios of human dependence on commercial harvests and damages to marine species. However, other economic and social impacts, such as changes in food security or livelihoods, are also likely to result from climate change. This study evaluates patterns of dependence on marine resources within Alaska that could be negatively impacted by OA and current community characteristics to assess the potential risk to the fishery sector from OA. Here, we used a risk assessment framework based on one developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to analyze earth-system global ocean model hindcasts and projections of ocean chemistry, fisheries harvest data, and demographic information. The fisheries examined were: shellfish, salmon and other finfish. The final index incorporates all of these data to compare overall risk among Alaska's federally designated census areas. The analysis showed that regions in southeast and southwest Alaska that are highly reliant on fishery harvests and have relatively lower incomes and employment alternatives likely face the highest risk from OA. Although this study is an intermediate step toward our full understanding, the results presented here show that OA merits consideration in policy planning, as it may represent another challenge to Alaskan communities, some of which are already under acute socio-economic strains.},

Am. 97, 3575–3588 (1995)], defined as the significant local maxima of the arrival pattern, is studied here as a modeling basis for performing ocean tomography. Peak arrivals constitute direct theoretical counterparts of experimentally observed peaks, and offer a complete modeling of experimental observables, even in cases where ray or modal arrivals cannot be resolved. The coefficients of the resulting peak-inversion system, relating travel-time with sound-speed perturbations, are explicitly calculated in the case of range-independent environments using normal-mode theory. To apply the peak-inversion scheme to tomography the peak identification and tracking problem is examined from a statistical viewpoint; maximum-likelihood and least-square solutions are derived and discussed. The particular approach adopted treats the identification and tracking problem in close relation to the inversion procedure; all possibilities of associating observed peaks with background arrivals are examined via trial inversions, and the best peak identification is selected with respect to a least-square criterion. The feasibility of peak tomography is subsequently demonstrated using first synthetic data and then measured data from the THETIS-I experiment. In the synthetic case the performance of the overall scheme is found to be satisfactory both with noise-free and noisy data. Furthermore, the identification, tracking, and inversion results using experimental acoustic data from THETIS-I are in good agreement with independent field observations.},

  abstract = {While the study of geometry has mainly concentrated on single viewpoint (SVP) cameras, there is growing attention to more general non-SVP systems. Here, we study an important class of systems that inherently have a non-SVP: a perspective camera imaging through an interface into a medium. Such systems are ubiquitous: They are common when looking into water-based environments. The paper analyzes the common flat-interface class of systems. It characterizes the locus of the viewpoints (caustic) of this class and proves that the SVP model is invalid in it. This may explain geometrical errors encountered in prior studies. Our physics-based model is parameterized by the distance of the lens from the medium interface, besides the focal length. The physical parameters are calibrated by a simple approach that can be based on a single frame. This directly determines the system geometry. The calibration is then used to compensate for modeled system distortion. Based on this model, geometrical measurements of objects are significantly more accurate than if based on an SVP model. This is demonstrated in real-world experiments. In addition, we examine by simulation the errors expected by using the SVP model. We show that when working at a constant range, the SVP model can be a good approximation. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {A new approach for the inversion of travel-time data is proposed, based on the matching between model arrivals and observed peaks. Using the linearized model relations between sound-speed and arrival-time perturbations about a set of background states, arrival times and associated errors are calculated on a fine grid of model states discretizing the sound-speed parameter space. Each model state can explain (identify) a number of observed peaks in a particular reception lying within the uncertainty intervals of the corresponding predicted arrival times. The model states that explain the maximum number of observed peaks are considered as the more likely parametric descriptions of the reception; these model states can be described in terms of mean values and variances providing a statistical answer (matched-peak solution) to the inversion problem. A basic feature of the matched-peak inversion approach is that each reception can be treated independently, i.e., no constraints are posed from previous-reception identification or inversion results. Accordingly, there is no need for initialization of the inversion procedure and, furthermore, discontinuous travel-time data can be treated. The matched-peak inversion method is demonstrated by application to 9-month-long travel-time data from the Thetis-2 tomography experiment in the western Mediterranean sea.},

  abstract = {Integrated acoustic communication and navigation for underwater vehicles provides dual functionality in a single system which reduces cost, size, power and potential acoustic interference. A combination of time and code division multiplexing is used to allow long baseline navigation and bidirectional communication for a number of vehicles operating simultaneously in the same area. The communication system uses multi-rate phase coherent modulation to maximize throughput for the uplink from a vehicle to a central node, and code-division multiple-access using a simple frequency-hopping scheme. The data rate and modulation methods are completely programmable and may be selected based on the application requirements and the propagation conditions present between the different vehicles in the network. While one or several vehicles may use time-multiplexed long-baseline (LBL) navigation, when the number of vehicles grows large, the time between fixes becomes unacceptably long. Thus in addition to LBL, a second mode of navigation is also available for use with swarms of vehicles such as the surf-zone crawlers proposed for mine counter-measure applications. This second mode employs navigation broadcasts initiated by the central controller and incorporates three additional fixed nodes that transmit in response. The time differences of arrival measured at the vehicle are used to determine its location.},

  abstract = {In the ocean, changes in the speed of sound can be related to changes in water 
temperature. By leveraging this relationship, acoustic methods – namely acoustic 
tomography- have been used to monitor temperature changes in the deep ocean for the 
purposes of providing inputs to climate change models. Traditionally, these acoustic 
methods involve loud, active sound sources which can be logistically challenging to 
operate and have been criticized for potentially disturbing marine animals. Therefore, this 
work demonstrates a passive acoustic method - previously only used in shallow water for 
short monitoring durations- that uses only recordings of low-frequency (1-40 Hz) 
ambient noise to continuously monitor variations in deep ocean temperature with an 
unprecedented degree of precision and temporal resolution. Numerical simulations were 
conducted to show the portions of the ocean that are monitored with this passive method. 
This work also provides recommendations (regarding sensor placement around the world) 
for future development of a global passive acoustic sensor network that makes use of 
distant noise sources (sea-ice or seismic sources) to extract meaningful information 
(whether temperature, currents, etc.) about the ocean.},

Most previous studies on the impacts of the biomedical bleeding process on horseshoe crabs have focused on mortality rates and sublethal impacts in the laboratory. In this study, we investigated the effects of the bleeding process on the behavior of horseshoe crabs after they had been released back into their natural environment. A total of 28 horseshoe crabs (14 control and 14 bled) were fitted with acoustic transmitters and released into the Great Bay Estuary, New Hampshire, during the spring of 2016. The acoustic tags transmitted information about the activity and depth of each animal, and these data were logged by an array of passive acoustic receivers. These data were collected from May to December 2016 and from March to October 2017. Bled animals approached mating beaches less than control animals during the first week after release, with the greatest differences between bled and control females. Bled animals also remained significantly deeper during the spawning season than control animals. However, overall, bled and control animals expressed similar biological rhythms and seasonal migrations. Thus, it appears as if the most obvious impacts of the bleeding process take place during the first one to two weeks after crabs are bled.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in wireless communication technology combined with significant increases in computing power have opened the way to Acoustically Focused Oceanographic Sampling (AFOS). AFOS consists of a network of acoustic arrays connected to a fleet of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) and to a shore station using wireless local area network technology. A real-time field estimate of temperature or current in the region of interest is computed by combining the various integral and local data sets available. The real-time field estimate and its associated error field are then used to adaptively direct AUVs towards regions where high resolution is required due to large gradients or large uncertainties. A feasibility experiment was recently performed in Haro Strait, British Columbia (June-July 1996). The novelty of the Haro Strait data set resides in its unusual tomographic features: ranges are short (less than 3 km), sound speed perturbations are small (2 to 3m/s), and currents are relatively strong (up to 5 kts). Operational constraints require that the field inversion be robust and computationally efficient. This thesis makes contributions to both the forward and the inverse problem. Numerically efficient solutions to the windy wave equation are presented in the wavenumber integration and the normal mode approaches using a unified theoretical formulation. Accurate numerical predictions of the acoustic field in the presence of a stratified flow are made using modified versions of the computer codes OASES and KRAKEN. A robust, hybrid linear inversion scheme adapted to the estimation of oceanic fields in coastal environments such as Haro Strait is then developed. Expressions for hybrid field estimates as well as their associated estimate variances are derived. These expressions enable the combination of multiple data streams of global and local nature in a robust and efficient fashion. Inversion performance is subsequently assessed, showing significant gains in coverage and estimated error from the combination of multiple data sets. Signal frequency coherence is shown to be a key asset in the Haro Strait environment. Second-order field statistics are computed, and the position of the Haro Strait front during flood tide on 06/20/96 was estimated.

A spectrogram-based method was implemented to discriminate whale sounds from background noise and the time-frequency envelope of the primary harmonic in the spectrogram was used as the basis for sound characterization. Sounds were typically (82\%, n = 45) in the 300- to 600-Hz range with up- and downsweeping modulations. Lower ({\textless}200 Hz) and higher ({\textgreater}900 Hz) frequency sounds were relatively rare. Most sounds were frequency modulated, with 95\% of the observed instantaneous relative frequency variation being within ±4.5\% of the mean peak frequency. Harmonics were observed in 18\% of the sounds. The average sound duration was 0.42 s ±0.26 SD. The sounds occurred at a rate of between 0.3 and 0.7 min-1. The time intervals between adjacent sounds (2-700 s) were not randomly distributed. The number of sounds occurring among different waiting times did not reflect a Poisson distribution and a clustering of sounds (2 to 5 cluster-1) was observed. The sound characteristics are compared to those documented elsewhere and as reported for the southern right whale.},

The paper gives an overview of the model configurations, experiments related forcings, and initialization procedures and presents results for the simulated changes in climate and carbon cycle. It is found that the climate feedback depends on the global warming and possibly the forcing history. The global warming from climatological 1850 conditions to 2080–2100 ranges from 1.5°C under the RCP2.6 scenario to 4.4°C under the RCP8.5 scenario. Over this range, the patterns of temperature and precipitation change are nearly independent of the global warming. The model shows a tendency to reduce the ocean heat uptake efficiency toward a warmer climate, and hence acceleration in warming in the later years. The precipitation sensitivity can be as high as 2.5\% K−1 if the CO2 concentration is constant, or as small as 1.6\% K−1, if the CO2 concentration is increasing. The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon increases over time in all scenarios, being smallest in the experiment forced by RCP2.6 and largest in that for RCP8.5. The land also serves as a net carbon sink in all scenarios, predominantly in boreal regions. The strong tropical carbon sources found in the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 experiments are almost absent in the RCP4.5 experiment, which can be explained by reforestation in the RCP4.5 scenario.},

In this paper, we present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which allows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation.},

75-Hz source suspended near the depth of the sound-channel axis to a
700-m long vertical receiving array approximately 3250 km distant in the
eastern North Pacific Ocean. The early part of the arrival pattern
consists of raylike wave fronts that are resolvable, identifiable, and
stable. The later part of the arrival pattern does not contain
identifiable raylike arrivals, due to scattering from
internal-wave-induced sound-speed fluctuations. The observed ray travel
times differ from ray predictions based on the sound-speed field
constructed using nearly concurrent temperature and salinity
measurements by more than a priori variability estimates, suggesting
that the equation used to compute sound speed requires refinement. The
range-averaged ocean sound speed can be determined with an uncertainty
of about 0.05 m/s from the observed ray travel times together with the
time at which the near-axial acoustic reception ends, used as a
surrogate for the group delay of adiabatic mode 1. The change in
temperature over six days can be estimated with an uncertainty of about
0.006 degrees C. The sensitivity of the travel times to ocean
variability is concentrated near the ocean surface and at the
corresponding conjugate depths, because all of the resolved ray arrivals
have upper turning depths within a few hundred meters of the surface.

  abstract = {Natural seepage from the seafloor is a worldwide phenomenon but quantitative measurements of gas release are rare, and the entire range of the dynamics of gas release in space, time, and strength remains unclear so far. To mitigate this, the hydroacoustic device GasQuant (180 kHz, multibeam) was developed to monitor the tempo-spatial variability of gas bubble releases from the seafloor. GasQuant was deployed in 2005 on the seafloor of the seep field Tommeliten (North Sea) for 36 h. This in situ approach provides much better spatial and temporal resolution of seeps than using conventional ship-born echo sounders. A total of 52 gas vents have been detected. Detailed time series analysis revealed a wide range of gas release patterns ranging from very short periodic up to 50 min long-lasting events. The bulk gas seepage in the studied area is active for more than 70\% of observation time. The venting clearly exhibits tidal control showing a peak in the second quarter of the tidal pressure cycle, where pressure drops fastest. The hydroacoustic results are compared with video observations and bubble flux estimates from remotely operated vehicle dives described in the literature. An advanced approach for identifying and visualizing rising bubbles in the sea by hydroacoustics is presented in which water current data were considered. Realizing that bubbles are moved by currents helps to improve the detection of gas bubbles in the data, better discriminate bubbles against fish echoes, and to enhance the S/N ratio in the per se noisy acoustic data. © 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography.},

  abstract = {In their comment piece, Laycock and Lam (Environ. Res. Lett. 13 068001) focused on the importance for reducing emissions of actions beyond individual choices and overconsumption, and raise the issue of family planning as a human right. Here we respond that both individual and collective actions, in private and professional life, are important to reducing emissions to near zero in the next few decades. While we do not argue that individual actions will be sufficient to achieve this profound transformation, we believe that they can be helpful towards this goal, and also note from our own observations that we see personal, professional, and collective actions as often mutually reinforcing rather than contradictory. Regarding overconsumption, we reiterate that our study was designed to illustrate the decisive role that consumption patterns play in driving greenhouse gas emissions, based on the understanding that wealthy, high-carbon individuals are responsible for a disproportionately large share of emissions. Regarding the ethics of family planning, we fully agree with Laycock and Lam (and international agreements) that family planning is a private decision. We give examples of our careful public communication around this issue to provide this context and thank them for the opportunity to do so. In their comment piece, Laycock and Lam provide insight into the discussion of high-impact climate actions, especially concerning the effect of communicating about family size. Here we respond to their thoughts on the scope of our research, including (1) the importance of actions beyond the private individual level, (2) the importance of overconsumption to an individual's emissions and (3) the ethics of communications pertaining to the planning of family size.},

The effect of pressure on the relative speeds of sound, (Up-UpH20)-(Uo-UoH20), have been fitted to an equation of the form (with a standard deviation of 0.19 msec-1) (Up-upqhu0-UoH2O)=AS(0/oo) + BS(°/oo){\textasciicircum}2+ CS(°/oo)2, where U and UH20arethe speeds of sound in seawater and pure water, respectively; superscripts P and O are used to denote applied pressure P and O (1 atm); A, B, and C are temperature-and pressure-dependent parameters; S(o/oo) is the salinity in parts per thousand. This equation has been combined with the refitted high-pressure pure-water sound-speed equation of Wilson [Naval Ordnance Lab. Rep. (1959)], Chen and Millero [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 60, 1270–1273 (1976)], and the 1-atm seawater sound-speed data of Millero and Kubinski [J. Acoust. Soc.

The bootstrap provides statistical inferences-standard error and bias estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests-without assumptions such as Normal distributions or equal variances. As such, bootstrap methods can be remarkably more accurate than classical inferences based on Normal or t distributions. The bootstrap uses the same basic procedure regardless of the statistic being calculated, without requiring the use of application-specific formulae. This article may provide two big surprises for many readers. The first is that the bootstrap shows that common t confidence intervals are woefully inaccurate when populations are skewed, with one-sided coverage levels off by factors of two or more, even for very large samples. The second is that the number of bootstrap samples required is much larger than generally realized.

Although the properties of the upper layers of the ocean can be routinely measured on large scales by satellite remote sensing (providing altimetric and infrared data) and with expendable probes dropped from commercial vessels, the deep interior of the ocean is more difficult to monitor. Ocean acoustic tomography is a promising technique for such applications, as it has the potential to provide systematic, instantaneous and repeated measurements of the ocean interior over large parts of an ocean basin. Here we demonstrate the capability of this technique for measuring the heat content across an entire (albeit small) ocean basin- the western Mediterranean Sea.},

The offset calibration problem, associated with the uncertainty regarding mooring positions and possible unresolved internal instrument delays, is also addressed using the peak-matching principle. The time offsets are estimated such that the total number of identifications, over all sections and all transmissions, is maximized. The same analysis also applies to the case of a moving receiver listening to a number of fixed sources.

Here we combine more than three decades of remotely sensed observational products of outlet glacier velocity, elevation, and front position changes over the full ice sheet. We compare decadal variability in discharge and calving front position and find that increased glacier discharge was due almost entirely to the retreat of glacier fronts, rather than inland ice sheet processes, with a remarkably consistent speedup of 4–5\% per km of retreat across the ice sheet. We show that widespread retreat between 2000 and 2005 resulted in a step-increase in discharge and a switch to a new dynamic state of sustained mass loss that would persist even under a decline in surface melt.},

  abstract = {The recent warming in the Arctic is affecting a broad spectrum of physical, ecological, and human/cultural systems that may be irreversible on century time scales and have the potential to cause rapid changes in the earth system. The response of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to changes in climate is a major issue of global concern, yet there has not been a comprehensive review of the status of the contemporary carbon cycle of the Arctic and its response to climate change. This review is designed to clarify key uncertainties and vulnerabilities in the response of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to ongoing climatic change. While it is clear that there are substantial stocks of carbon in the Arctic, there are also significant uncertainties associated with the magnitude of organic matter stocks contained in permafrost and the storage of methane hydrates beneath both subterranean and submerged permafrost of the Arctic. In the context of the global carbon cycle, this review demonstrates that the Arctic plays an important role in the global dynamics of both CO 2 and CH4. Studies suggest that the Arctic has been a sink for atmospheric CO2 of between 0 and 0.8 Pg C/yr in recent decades, which is between 0\% and 25\% of the global net land/ocean flux during the 1990s. The Arctic is a substantial source of CH4 to the atmosphere (between 32 and 112 Tg CH4/yr), primarily because of the large area of wetlands throughout the region. Analyses to date indicate that the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the Arctic during the remainder of the 21st century is highly uncertain. To improve the capability to assess the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to projected climate change, we recommend that (1) integrated regional studies be conducted to link observations of carbon dynamics to the processes that are likely to influence those dynamics, and (2) the understanding gained from these integrated studies be incorporated into both uncoupled and fully coupled carbon-climate modeling efforts. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The pertinent properties of the SOFAR Channel, such as the vertical trapping and the low rate of attenuation of acoustic energy, are discussed briefly. In particular it is shown that useful acoustic ranges in excess of 1000 km are possible for tracking Swallow floats. Two floats have been built and the details of these, which were designed for 9-12 months operation, are given. The signals from the float, which must be received at at least two hydrophones, are detected in 1 Hz wide bandpass filters and the output is recorded continuously in digital form. The time of arrival of the signals is determined from a visual display of the data. The first two experiments have clearly shown that transmission over these distances is feasible.

  abstract = {We describe the use of bivariate three-dimensional empirical orthogonalfunctions (EOFs) in characterising low frequency variability of the Atlanticthermohaline circulation (THC) in the Hadley Centre global climate model,HadCM3. We find that the leading two modes are well correlated with an index ofthe meridional overturning circulation (MOC) on decadal timescales, with theleading mode alone accounting for 54\% of the decadal variance. Episodes ofcoherent oscillations in the sub-space of the leading EOFs are identified;these episodes are of great interest for the predictability of the THC, andcould indicate the existence of different regimes of natural variability. Themechanism identified for the multi-decadal variability is an internal oceanmode, dominated by changes in convection in the Nordic Seas, which lead thechanges in the MOC by a few years. Variations in salinity transports from theArctic and from the North Atlantic are the main feedbacks which control theoscillation. This mode has a weak feedback onto the atmosphere and hence asurface climatic influence. Interestingly, some of these climate impacts lead the changes in the overturning. Thereare also similarities to observed multi-decadal climate variability. © Springer-Verlag 2007.},

Its applications are manifold, ranging from marine and ecosystem forecasting to climate prediction and studies of the carbon cycle. Here, we address only climate applications, which range from improving our understanding of ocean circulation to estimating initial or boundary conditions and model parameters for ocean and climate forecasts. Because of differences in underlying methodologies, data assimilation products must be used judiciously and selected according to the specific purpose, as not all related inferences would be equally reliable. Further advances are expected from improved models and methods for estimating and representing error information in data assimilation systems. Ultimately, data assimilation into coupled climate system components is needed to support ocean and climate services. However, maintaining the infrastructure and expertise for sustained data assimilation remains challenging.},

These data were used to quantify changes in the ice cover's composition, revealing a substantial reduction of about 14 percent in the area of multiyear ice in winter during the period from 1978 to 1998. There also appears to be a strong correlation between the area of multiyear ice and the spatially averaged thickness of the perennial ice pack, which suggests that the satellite- derived areal decreases represent substantial rather than only peripheral changes. If this apparent transformation continues, it may lead to a markedly different ice regime in the Arctic, altering heat and mass exchanges as well as ocean stratification.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

This multiple vehicle navigation technique consists of using vehicles fitted with accurate navigation systems as moving reference transponders to which other vehicles, fitted with less capable navigation systems, can acoustically range to update their position. Reliable acoustic communications are mandatory for the real time implementation of this navigation scheme. However, while enabling MLBL, acoustic communications reduce the range update rate and introduce delays that need to be dealt with in the navigation algorithm. Simulation results show that relative navigation accuracy between vehicles can be maintained although the absolute navigation accuracy of each vehicle decreases over time. This is a key enabling factor for AOFNC missions where contacts are called by vehicles and re-acquired by other vehicles in real-time. ©2004 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The goal of adaptive sampling in the ocean is to predict the types and locations of additional ocean measurements that would be most useful to collect. Quantitatively, what is most useful is defined by an objective function and the goal is then to optimize this objective under the constraints of the available observing network. Examples of objectives are better oceanic understanding, to improve forecast quality, or to sample regions of high interest. This work provides a new path-planning scheme for the adaptive sampling problem. We define the path-planning problem in terms of an optimization framework and propose a method based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The mathematical goal is to find the vehicle path that maximizes the line integral of the uncertainty of field estimates along this path. Sampling this path can improve the accuracy of the field estimates the most. While achieving this objective, several constraints must be satisfied and are implemented. They relate to vehicle motion, intervehicle coordination, communication, collision avoidance, etc. The MILP formulation is quite powerful to handle different problem constraints and flexible enough to allow easy extensions of the problem. The formulation covers single- and multiple-vehicle cases as well as singleand multiple-day formulations. The need for a multiple-day formulation arises when the ocean sampling mission is optimized for several days ahead. We first introduce the details of the formulation, then elaborate on the objective function and constraints, and finally, present a varied set of examples to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. © 2008 IEEE.},

Existing evidence shows that anthrophony affects marine animals at multiple levels, including their behavior, physiology, and, in extreme cases, survival. This should prompt management actions to deploy existing solutions to reduce noise levels in the ocean, thereby allowing marine animals to reestablish their use of ocean sound as a central ecological trait in a healthy ocean.},

  abstract = {During a 2 day period in mid-September 2006, more than 200, unconfirmed but identifiable, sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) calls were collected as incidental data during a multidisciplinary oceanography and acoustics experiment on the shelf off New Jersey. Using a combined vertical and horizontal acoustic receiving array, sei whale movements were tracked over long distances (up to tens of kilometers) using a normal mode back propagation technique. This approach uses low-frequency, broadband passive sei whale call receptions from a single-station, two-dimensional hydrophone array to perform long distance localization and tracking by exploiting the dispersive nature of propagating normal modes in a shallow water environment. The back propagation approach is examined for accuracy and application to tracking the sei whale vocalizations identified in the vertical and horizontal array signals. This passive whale tracking, combined with the intensive oceanography measurements performed during the experiment, was also used to examine sei whale movements in relation to oceanographic features observed in this region.},

  abstract = {Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are typically derived from direct measurements of the sound speed profile (SSP) and they are orthogonal in regard to the statistics of the SSP uncertainty. Viewed from the output end of a particular sonar system, however, the effect of an error in one EOF is usually coupled with the effect of the error in another due to the strongly nonlinear relation between the SSP parameters and the system response. In this paper, a new set of basis functions, orthogonal in regard to sonar performance measure, is developed to characterize SSP perturbations. The performance measure used is the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for SSP expansion coefficients derived from a full-field random Gaussian signal model; a closed-form, analytical solution is obtained for both the range-independent and adiabatically range-dependent environments. The derived functions make the CRB matrix diagonal, decoupling the errors in the estimation of the expansion coefficients. Compared to the EOFs, the new set of basis functions depends on both the statistics of the sound speed uncertainty and the sound waveguide propagation property; it incorporates the measurement noise as well. The development makes possible the investigation of the relative significance of the individual basis functions in system response; it also provides a novel framework for optimum acoustic parameterization in adaptive rapid environmental assessment. © 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale mapping of the ocean sound speed field in a 1000×1000 km area by means of ocean acoustic tomography is greatly enhanced by augmenting a few acoustic moorings with a movable ship-based receiver. Computer simulations based on realistic noise levels in the measured acoustic travel times give 5\% (1\%) residual variance in ΔC(x;y,z) for four (six) acoustic source moorings in an ocean perturbed in the gravest baroclinic mode. For comparison, objective mapping based on traditional vertical profiles requires 3 times the steaming distance to yield equivalent residual error. Detailed results depend on many parameters: the assumed mesoscale spectrum and vertical mode structure, the number of observed multipaths, the mooring configuration, the number of ship stations and the travel time signal level (due to mesoscale eddies) and noise level (due to internal waves and position-keeping errors). These parameters have critical values, below which there is distinct deterioration and beyond which there is little gain. We believe that the critical values can be attained in practice so the ultimate limit on mesoscale mapping is imposed by the internal wave-induced travel time error. This assumes that position keeping of the submerged acoustic sources and receiver by a combination of satellite navigation and high-frequency acoustics can be achieved with ±10-m accuracy. The present study assumes a stationary ocean; a second paper will deal with reciprocal transmissions yielding currents and hence the barotropic mode. This is required in a dynamic ocean model for estimating ΔC(x,y,z;t). All this is preparatory to a tomography experiment in the Greenland Sea in 1988–1989.},

A variety of scientific, management, and safety-related objectives motivate marine scientists to characterize many ocean environments, including coastal regions. As in weather prediction, the accurate representation of physical, chemical, and or biological properties in the ocean is challenging. Models and observations alone provide imperfect representations of the ocean state, but together they can offer improved estimates. Variational and sequential methods are among the most widely used in regional ocean systems, and there have been exciting recent advances in ensemble and four-dimensional variational approaches. These techniques are increasingly being tested and adapted for biogeochemical applications.},

Our method's key is assimilation radius, where various radii provide different SSPs. By means of the Bellhop acoustic model and acoustic data, we calculated the optimal SSP assimilation radius. Due to the lack of proper in-situ observations, an SSP inversion method is proposed. Inverted SSP compared to assimilated SSP indicates close correlation, showing that both methods yield reliable results. Historical data analysis indicates a stable correlation structure under certain conditions, implying the optimal assimilation radius would measure SSP effectively under similar conditions.},

  abstract = {The use of adjoint modeling for acoustic inversion is investigated. An adjoint model is derived from a linearized forward propagation model to propagate data-model misfit at the observation points back through the medium to the medium perturbations not being accounted for in the model. This adjoint model can be used to aid in inverting for these unaccounted medium perturbations. Adjoint methods are being applied to a variety of inversion problems, but have not drawn much attention from the underwater acoustic community. This paper presents an application of adjoint methods to acoustic inversion. Inversions are demonstrated in simulation for both range-independent and range-dependent sound speed profiles using the adjoint of a parabolic equation model. Sensitivity and error analyses are discussed showing how the adjoint model enables calculations to be performed in the space of observations, rather than the often much larger space of model parameters. Using an adjoint model enables directions of steepest descent in the model parameters ?what we invert for? to be calculated using far fewer modeling runs than if a forward model only were used. © 2004 Acoustical Society of America. ?DOI: 10.1121/1.1636760?},

Inflow of warm and outflow of melt-enriched waters are identified in two seafloor troughs to the north. Spatial property gradients highlight a previously unknown convergence zone in one trough, where different water masses meet and mix.

To enable such capabilities, robots are being enhanced by advances ranging from new sensor development to automated mission planning software, distributed robotic control, and more efficient power systems.

The mean path of the PF is strongly steered by the topographic features of the Southern Ocean. The topography places vorticity constraints on the dynamics of the PF that strongly affect spatial and temporal variability. Over the deep ocean basins the surface expression of the PF is weakened, and the PF meanders over a wide latitudinal range. Near large topographic features, width and temperature change across the front increase, and large-scale meandering is inhibited. Elevated mesoscale variability is seen within and downstream of these areas and may be the result of baroclinic instabilities initiated where the PF encounters large topographic features. The strong correlations between topography and PF dynamics can be understood in the context of the planetary potential vorticity (PPV or f/H) field. Mean PPV at the PF varies by more than a factor of 2 along its circumpolar path. However, at the mesoscale the PF remains within a relatively narrow range of PPV values around the local mean. Away from large topographic features, the PF returns to a preferred PPV value of ∼25 × 10-9 m-1 s-1 despite large latitudinal shifts. The mean paths of the surface and subsurface expressions of the PF are closely coupled over much of the Southern Ocean. Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.},

  abstract = {The paper develops and demonstrates a method of classifying oceanographic processes using an autonomous-underwater vehicle (AUV). First, we establish the "mingled-spectrum principle" which concisely relates observations from a moving platform to the frequency-wavenumber spectrum of the surveyed process. This principle clearly reveals the role of the AUV speed in mingling time and space. An AUV can distinguish between oceanographic processes by jointly utilizing temporal and spatial information. A parametric tool for designing an AUV spectral classifier is then developed based on the mingled-spectrum principle. An AUV's controllable speed tunes the separability between the mingled spectra of different processes. This property is the key to optimizing the classifier's performance. As a case study, AUV-based classification is applied to distinguish ocean convection from internal waves. It is demonstrated that at a higher AUV speed, convection's distinct spatial feature is highlighted to the advantage of classification. Finally, the AUV classifier is tested by the Labrador Sea Convection Experiment of February 1998. We installed an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter in an AUV and it measured flow velocity in the Labrador Sea. Based on the vertical flow velocity, the AUV-based classifier captures convection's occurrence. This finding is supported by other oceanographic observations in the same experiment.},

  abstract = {Global sea ice products are produced from the Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard both the Terra and Aqua satellites. Daily sea ice extent and ice surface temperature (IST) products are available at 1- and 4-km resolution. Validation activities during the "cold period" (when meltwater is generally not present) in the Northern Hemisphere, defined here as October through May, have been undertaken to assess the accuracy of the 1-km resolution MODIS IST algorithm and product. Validation was also done at the South Pole station in Antarctica. In the Arctic Ocean, near-surface air temperatures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) Alaska tide stations and from drifting buoys from the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) buoy program were compared with MODIS-derived ISTs. Using the standard MODIS sea ice product, which utilizes the MODIS cloud mask, results show a bias (mean error) of -2,1 K and a root mean square (RMS) error of 3.7 K. The negative bias means that the satellite retrieval is less than the air temperature. With the bias removed, the RMS error is 3.0 K. When additional visual cloud screening is performed to eliminate MODIS pixels thought to be contaminated by fog, results improved, with a subset of the larger dataset showing a bias of -0.9 K and an RMS error of 1.6 K. Uncertainties would be reduced in the Arctic Ocean dataset if the skin temperature of the sea ice were reported instead of the near-surface air temperatures. With the bias removed, the RMS error for the Arctic Ocean dataset is 1.3 K. Results from the South Pole station in Antarctica show that under clear skies as determined using lidar measurements, the MODIS ISTs are also very close to those of the near-surface air temperatures with a bias of -1.2 K and an RMS error of 1.7 K. With the bias removed, the RMS error for the South Pole dataset is 1.2 K. Thus, the accuracy (RMS error) of the IST measurement is 1.2-1.3 K. It is not possible to obtain an accurate IST from MODIS in the presence of even very thin clouds or fog, and this is the main limitation of the MODIS ice surface temperature product. MODIS sea ice products may be ordered from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, CO.},

  abstract = {We have measured perturbation of the sound speed δC(x,y,z) (temperature) field within an ocean volume by repeated acoustic transmissions through the volume along many different ray paths i (Ocean Tomography Group, 1982). The data set consisted of ray travel time perturbations δti, and the sound field was obtained by inverse theory from a linear weighted sum δC(x,y,z)=ΣiAi−1 (x,y,z) δti, where Ai is the time spent by ray i in a differential volume centered on x,y,z. Here the method is extended to cases (e.g. the ‘axial’ ocean near a sound speed minimum) where ray theory is not applicable or not convenient. This is done by including in the data set the frequency perturbation δf of lower modes. The matrix A is generalized to a combination of ray weighting and mode weighting. The procedures are illustrated for bilinear and quadratic sound channels, corresponding to a last and first arrival, respectively, of the axial ray, and for a cosh z profile (surprisingly close to some measured equatorial sound speed profiles) where all rays arrive together. We use a northwest Atlantic profile for illustration of an actual case, and here we find overlapping arrival sequences which lead to additional complexities. All this is conveniently displayed in frequency‐time (ambiguity) diagrams. We discuss two inversion schemes: one based on Abel transforms and the other on numerical matrix inversions. The latter scheme is more straightforward for perturbations from a known initial state. The paper is a review of the underlying principles; application to measurements is planned in the near future.

  abstract = {© 2015 Acoustical Society of America. The reduction of information capacity of the ocean sound channel due to scattering by internal waves is a potential problem for acoustic communication, navigation, and remote sensing over long ranges. In spite of recent progress in research on acoustic signal scattering by random internal waves and the fact that random internal waves are ubiquitous in the world oceans, there is no clear understanding of how these waves influence data communication performance. The entropy decrease resulting from scattering by internal waves is an important measure of information loss. Here a rigorous calculation of the entropy is carried out using second moment transport theory equations with random sound-speed perturbations obeying the Garrett-Munk internal-wave model. It is shown that full-wave rate of entropy is of the same order of magnitude as the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and Lyapunov exponents for the relevant ray trajectories. The correspondence between full-wave and ray entropies suggests a correspondence between full-wave scattering and ray chaos near statistical saturation. The relatively small level of entropy rate during propagation through the random internal-wave field shows that scattering by internal waves is likely not an essential limitation for data rate and channel capacity.},

  abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}During the Acoustic Engineering Test (AET) of the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) program, acoustic signals were transmitted from a broadband source with 75-Hz center frequency to a 700-m-long vertical array of 20 hydrophones at a distance of 3252 km receptions occurred over a period of-six days. Each received pulse showed early identifiable timefronts, followed by about 2 s of highly variable energy. For the identifiable timefronts, observations of travel-time variance, average pulse shape, and the probability density function (PDF) of intensity are presented, and calculations of internal-wave contributions to those fluctuations are compared to the observations. Individual timefronts have rms travel time fluctuations of 11 to 19 ms, with time scales of less than 2 h. The pulse time spreads are between 0 and 5.3 ms rms, which suggest that internal-wave-induced travel-time biases are of the same magnitude. The PDFs of intensity for individual ray arrivals are compared to log-normal and exponential distributions. The observed PDFs are closer to the log-normal distribution, and variances of log intensity are between (3.1 dB)(2) (with a scintillation index of 0.74) for late-arriving timefronts and (2.0 dB)(2) (with a scintillation index of 0.2) for the earliest timefronts. Fluctuations of the pulse termination time of the transmissions are observed to be 22 ms rms. The intensity PDF of nonidentified peaks in the pulse crescendo are closer to a log-normal distribution than an exponential distribution, but a Kolmogorov-Smimov test rejects both distributions. The variance of the nonidentified peaks is (3.5 dB)(2) land the-scintillation index is 0.92. As a group, the observations suggest that the propagation is on the border of the unsaturated and partially saturated regimes. After improving the specification of the. ray weighting function, predictions of travel-time variance using the Garrett-Munk (GM) internal-wave spectrum at one-half the reference energy are in good agreement with the observations, and the one-half GM energy level compares well with XBT data taken along the transmission path. Predictions of pulse spread and wave propagation regime are in strong disagreement with the observations. Pulse time spread estimates are nearly two orders of magnitude too large, and Lambda-Phi methods for predicting the wave propagation regime predict full saturation.

To examine the MODAS fields, the authors also used data from the Southern California Bight collected by the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations as well as high-resolution hydrographic data collected over the continental shelf south of New England as part of the shelfbreak PRIMER experiment. MODAS performs well for features such as large-scale boundary currents and eddies but is more limited in resolving features such as shelfbreak and coastal fronts, which have small spatial and temporal correlation scales. Because of the considerable computational needs of other ESME modules and its use as a planning tool, the authors present a pragmatic approach for future applications. © 2006 IEEE.},

The July-August mean mixed layer depth based on the Ice-Tethered Profiler data averaged 16 m (an overestimate due to the Ice-Tethered Profiler sampling characteristics and present analysis procedures), while the average winter mixed layer depth was only 24 m, with individual observations rarely exceeding 40 m. Guidance interpreting the observations is provided by a 1-D ocean mixed layer model. The analysis focuses attention on the very strong density stratification at the base of the mixed layer in the Canada Basin that greatly impedes surface layer deepening and thus limits the flux of deep ocean heat to the surface that could influence sea ice growth/decay. The observations additionally suggest that efficient lateral mixed layer restratification processes are active in the Arctic, also impeding mixed layer deepening.

  abstract = {Ocean reanalyses combine ocean models, atmospheric forcing fluxes, and observations using data assimilation to give a four-dimensional description of the ocean. Metrics assessing their reliability have improved over time, allowing reanalyses to become an important tool in climate services that provide a more complete picture of the changing ocean to end users. Besides climate monitoring and research, ocean reanalyses are used to initialize sub-seasonal to multi-annual predictions, to support observational network monitoring, and to evaluate climate model simulations. These applications demand robust uncertainty estimates and fit-for-purpose assessments, achievable through sustained advances in data assimilation and coordinated inter-comparison activities. Ocean reanalyses face specific challenges: i) dealing with intermittent or discontinued observing networks, ii) reproducing inter-annual variability and trends of integrated diagnostics for climate monitoring, iii) accounting for drift and bias due e.g. to air-sea flux or ocean mixing errors, iv) optimizing initialization and improving performances during periods and in regions with sparse data. Other challenges such as multi-scale data assimilation to reconcile mesoscale and large-scale variability and flow-dependent error characterization for rapidly evolving processes, are amplified in long-term reanalyses. The demand to extend reanalyses backward in time requires tackling all these challenges, especially in the emerging context of earth system reanalyses and coupled data assimilation. This mini-review aims at documenting recent advances from the ocean reanalysis community, discussing unsolved challenges that require sustained activities for maximizing the utility of ocean observations, supporting data rescue and advancing specific research and development requirements for reanalyses.},

In addition, methods which require inverting the tomographic data to a physical space grid before insertion into the model as point measurements incur special problems because of the non-local nature of the errors. We give a simple 1-D example to illustrate the problems that can arise.

In computer vision the focus is on extracting information from image data, whereas in image processing the focus is on transforming images.

  abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA), driven by rising anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), is rapidly advancing in the Pacific Arctic Region (PAR), producing conditions newly corrosive to biologically important carbonate minerals like aragonite. Naturally short linkages across the PAR food web mean that species-specific acidification stress can be rapidly transmitted across multiple trophic levels, resulting in widespread impacts. Therefore, it is critical to understand the formation, transport, and persistence of acidified conditions in the PAR in order to better understand and project potential impacts to this delicately balanced ecosystem. Here, we synthesize data from process studies across the PAR to show the formation of corrosive conditions in colder, denser winter-modified Pacific waters over shallow shelves, resulting from the combination of seasonal terrestrial and marine organic matter respiration with anthropogenic CO2. When these waters are subsequently transported off the shelf, they acidify the Pacific halocline. We estimate that Barrow Canyon outflow delivers {\textasciitilde}2.24 Tg C yr-1 to the Arctic Ocean through corrosive winter water transport. This synthesis also allows the combination of spatial data with temporal data to show the persistence of these conditions in halocline waters. For example, one study in this synthesis indicated that 0.5–1.7 Tg C yr-1 may be returned to the atmosphere via air-sea gas exchange of CO2 during upwelling events along the Beaufort Sea shelf that bring Pacific halocline waters to the ocean surface. The loss of CO2 during these events is more than sufficient to eliminate corrosive conditions in the upwelled Pacific halocline waters. However, corresponding moored and discrete data records indicate that potentially corrosive Pacific waters are present in the Beaufort shelfbreak jet during 80\% of the year, indicating that the persistence of acidified waters in the Pacific halocline far outweighs any seasonal mitigation from upwelling. Across the datasets in this large-scale synthesis, we estimate that the persistent corrosivity of the Pacific halocline is a recent phenomenon that appeared between 1975 and 1985. Over that short time, these potentially corrosive waters originating over the continental shelves have been observed as far as the entrances to Amundsen Gulf and M'Clure Strait in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The formation and transport of corrosive waters on the Pacific Arctic shelves may have widespread impact on the Arctic biogeochemical system and food web reaching all the way to the North Atlantic.},

  abstract = {Data graphics shape the way science is communicated, and the color schemes we employ can either faithfully represent or tacitly obscure the data a figure is intended to convey (Tufte, 1983). Tasteful use of color can make data graphics visually appealing and can draw viewers in, engaging the audience and encouraging further inspection of a figure. But wherever color is used to represent numerical values, its role transitions from a mere aesthetic nicety to carrying the responsibility of conveying data honestly and accurately. Yet, biases introduced by some common colormaps have gone widely unrecognized within the oceanographic community. Here, we describe the pitfalls of some commonly used colormaps, provide guidelines on effective, accurate colormap selection, and present a suite of perceptually uniform cmocean colormaps that have been designed for oceanographic data display. The cmocean package is available across multiple software programs, including MATLAB, Python, R, Generic Mapping Tools, and Ocean Data Viewer.},

  abstract = {Autonomous marine vehicles are increasingly used in clusters for an array of oceano- graphic tasks. The effectiveness of this collaboration is often limited by communications: throughput, latency, and ease of reconfiguration. This thesis argues that improved com- munication on intelligent marine robotic agents can be gained from acting on knowledge gained by improved awareness of the physical acoustic link and higher network layers by the AUV’s decision making software. This thesis presents a modular acoustic networking framework, realized through a C++ library called goby-acomms, to provide collaborating underwater vehicles with an efficient short-range single-hop network. goby-acommsis comprised of fourcomponents that provide: 1) losslessly compressed encoding of short messages; 2) a set of message queues that dynamically prioritize messages based both on overall importance and time sensitivity; 3) Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) Medium Access Control (MAC) with automatic discovery; and 4) an abstract acoustic modem driver. Building on this networking framework, two approaches that use the vehicle’s “in- telligence” to improve communications are presented. The first is a “non-disruptive” approach which is a novel technique for using state observers in conjunction with an en- tropy source encoder to enable highly compressed telemetry of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) position vectors. This system was analyzed on experimental data and im- plemented on a fielded vehicle. Using an adaptive probability distribution in combina- tion with either of two state observer models, greater than 90\% compression, relative to a 32-bit integer baseline, was achieved. The second approach is “disruptive,” as it changes the vehicle’s course to effect an im- provement in the communications channel. Ahybrid data- and model-based autonomous environmental adaptation framework is presented which allows autonomous underwa- ter vehicles (AUVs) with acoustic sensors to follow a path which optimizes their ability to maintain connectivity with an acoustic contact for optimal sensing or communication.},

We present a new twist on this classic problem where, instead of having the training set contain an individual output value for each input vector, the output values in the training set are only given in aggregate over a number of input vectors. This new problem arose from a particular need in learning on mass spectrometry data, but could easily apply to situations when data has been aggregated in order to maintain privacy. We provide a formal description of this new problem for both classification and regression.

This presents a challenge to existing ray-tracing based methods, which are widely adopted to simulate propagation due to their efficiency and flexibility, but assume linear rays. We present a novel algorithm that traces analytic ray curves computed from local media gradients, and utilizes the closed-form solutions of both the intersections of the ray curves with planar surfaces, and the travel distance. By constructing an adaptive unstructured mesh, our algorithm is able to model general media profiles that vary in three dimensions with complex boundaries consisting of terrains and other scene objects such as buildings. Our analytic ray curve tracer with the adaptive mesh improves the efficiency considerably over prior methods. We highlight the algorithm's application on simulation of visual and sound propagation in outdoor scenes.},

  abstract = {A new method is developed in which a single standard target is used to calibrate the system response of broadband monostatic active acoustic systems. Spheres have commonly been used to calibrate narrowband systems. A major challenge involves the resonances of the scattering by the sphere. For narrowband systems, the sphere is designed so that the acoustic frequency is between the resonances. However, this cannot be done for broadband systems as the frequencies will span multiple resonances. Our method completely eliminates the source of the resonances through pulse-compression processing of the signal. Through this processing, the echo from the front interface of the sphere is isolated from other echoes which cause the resonances. The echo from the front interface is generally weakly dependent upon frequency, making it ideal for calibrating a broadband system. The method is a generalization of what was proposed by Dragonette et al. (J. Acoustic. Soc. Am. 69, 1186-1189 (1981). The advances in this new method involve incorporation of signal processing to better isolate the echo, as well as a more accurate treatment of the scattering physics. As a result, the approach is applicable over a wide range of conditions. ©2008 IEEE.},

This sound has been recorded in the Bay of Fundy, Canada from both single whales (n = 9) and social surface active groups (n = 49). Those single whales producing Gunshot sounds whose sex could be determined (n = 9) were all mature males. Gunshot sounds were produced as part of a stereotyped behavioral sequence by these individuals, including frequent head-lifts and flipper slapping at the surface. In surface active groups, Gunshot sounds were commonly recorded when males were present in the group. The rate of production of Gunshot sounds was weakly correlated with the total number of males present in the group. Given the behavioral context of Gunshot sound production, and production of the sound only by male whales, Gunshots may function in a reproductive context as an advertisement signal to attract females, an agonistic signal directed toward other males, or a combination of the two functions. © 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

  abstract = {Unprecedented quantities of heat are entering the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean through Bering Strait, particularly during summer months. Though some heat is lost to the atmosphere during autumn cooling, a significant fraction of the incoming warm, salty water subducts (dives beneath) below a cooler fresher layer of near-surface water, subsequently extending hundreds of kilometers into the Beaufort Gyre. Upward turbulent mixing of these sub-surface pockets of heat is likely accelerating sea ice melt in the region. This Pacific-origin water brings both heat and unique biogeochemical properties, contributing to a changing Arctic ecosystem. However, our ability to understand or forecast the role of this incoming water mass has been hampered by lack of understanding of the physical processes controlling subduction and evolution of this this warm water. Crucially, the processes seen here occur at small horizontal scales not resolved by regional forecast models or climate simulations; new parameterizations must be developed that accurately represent the physics. Here we present novel high resolution observations showing the detailed process of subduction and initial evolution of warm Pacific-origin water in the southern Beaufort Gyre.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to synthesize realistic environment for ocean-acoustic parametric studies. In its current form, this methodology applies to internal waves and tides. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition is applied to a temporal series of temperature profiles. It can be observed that the first two time-dependent expansion coefficients are dynamically linked. When they are plotted one versus another in a scatter diagram, the cloud of points consists of a crescent shape that can easily be represented by a polynomial fit. If the first two expansion coefficients capture enough variability in the temperature profiles, the EOF modes plus the polynomial can be used to reconstruct temperature profiles independently from the set of data. This realistic synthesized environment can then be input to acoustic propagation models. This approach is applied to the case of the Messina Strait in which internal waves are known to be intensive. From a short-term series of temperature profiles collected on a thermistor string, range-dependent profiles along and across the strait are reconstructed. The acoustical impact study is conducted with the range-dependent acoustic model (RAM) parabolic equation (PE) model. The methodology presented in this paper is simple to run and requires a very affordable set of data. It could be used as an efficient alternative to ocean and acoustic model coupling for process studies or for regional studies especially in poorly known areas or highly variable areas, where it is difficult to obtain good sound-speed profile prediction from ocean models. © 2011 IEEE.},

These techniques, similar to the idea of radiosity, are based on the subdivision of the space into elements. Then we describe acceleration techniques that can be used in combination with other methods to speed up calculations.

The effects of mismatch on a conventional beamformer and two optimum beamformers are compared. One optimum beamformer is based on inversion of the noise cross-spectral matrix while the other is based on inversion of the signal-plus -noise cross-spectral matrix. When there is mismatch, the inclusion of the signal in the matrix inversion process can lead to dramatic reductions in the output signal-to-noise ratio when the output signal-to-noise ratio of a perfectly matched beamformer would be greater than unity. However, the corresponding effect on the total beamformer output is less dramatic since an increase in the noise response partially offsets the decrease in signal response. The question of suppressing mismatched signals is closely related to the question of resolving closely spaced sources. Exact conditions are presented for resolution of closely spaced sources by an optimum beamformer. These results are applied to a line array and compared with the resolution capability of a conventional beamformer. It is found, for example, that an output signal-to-noise ratio of about 47 dB is required to achieve a resolving power with an optimum processor which is ten times that given by the classical Rayleigh limit. Conditions are also presented for the resolution of two sources of unequal strength. © 1986, American Association of Physics Teachers. All rights reserved.},

This warming is linked to anomalous solar heating of surface waters in the northern Chukchi Sea, a main entryway for halocline waters to join the interior Beaufort Gyre. Summer solar heat absorption by the surface waters has increased fivefold over the same time period, chiefly because of reduced sea ice coverage. It is shown that the solar heating, considered together with subduction rates of surface water in this region, is sufficient to account for the observed halocline warming. Heat absorption at the basin margins and its subsequent accumulation in the ocean interior, therefore, have consequences for Beaufort Gyre sea ice beyond the summer season.},

  abstract = {Broadband echosounders, which transmit frequency-modulated pulses, increase the spectral characterization of targets relative to narrowband echosounders, which typically transmit single-frequency pulses, and also increase the range resolution through broadband matchedfilter signal processing approaches. However, the increased range resolution does not necessarily lead to improved detection and characterization of targets close to boundaries due to the presence of undesirable signal processing side lobes. The standard approach to mitigating the impact of processing side lobes is to transmit tapered signals, which has the consequence of also reducing spectral information. To address this, different broadband signal processing approaches are explored using data collected in a large tank with both a Kongsberg-Simrad EK80 scientific echosounder with a combination of single- and split-beam transducers with nominal centre frequencies of 18, 38, 70, 120, 200, and 333 kHz, and with a single-beam custom-built echosounder spanning the frequency band from 130 to 195 kHz. It is shown that improved detection and characterization of targets close to boundaries can be achieved by using modified replica signals in the matched filter processing. An additional benefit to using broadband echosounders involves exploiting the frequency dependence of the beam pattern to calibrate single-beam broadband echosounders using an off-axis calibration sphere.},

  abstract = {Turbulent mixing and background current were observed using a microstructure profiler and acoustic Doppler current profilers in the Tokara Strait, where many seamounts and small islands exist within the route of the Kuroshio in the East China Sea. Vertical structure and water properties of the Kuroshio were greatly modified downstream from shallow seamounts. In the lee of a seamount crest at 200 m depth, the modification made the flow tend to shear instability, and the vertical eddy diffusivity is enhanced by nearly 100 times that of the upstream site, to Kq ? O(1023)–O(1022)m2 s21. A one-dimensional diffusion model using the observed eddy diffusivity reproduced the observed downstream evolution of the temperature- salinity profile. However, the estimated diffusion time-scale is at least 10 times longer than the observed advection time-scale. This suggests that the eddy diffusivity reaches to O(1021)m2 s21 in the vicinity of the seamount. At a site away from the abrupt topography, eddy diffusivity was also elevated to O(1023)m2 s21, and was associated with shear instability presumably induced by the Kuroshio shear and near-inertial inter- nal-wave shear. Our study suggests that a better prediction of current, water-mass properties, and nutrients within the Kuroshio requires accurate understanding and parameterization of flow-topography interaction such},

  abstract = {The Denmark Strait Overflow (DSO) supplies about one-third of the North Atlantic Deep Water and is critical to global thermohaline circulation. Knowledge of the pathways of DSO through the Irminger Basin and its transformation there is still incomplete, however. The authors deploy over 10 000 Lagrangian particles at the Denmark Strait in a high-resolution ocean model to study these issues. First, the particle trajectories show that the mean position and potential density of dense waters cascading over the Denmark Strait sill evolve consistently with hydrographic observations. These sill particles transit the Irminger Basin to the Spill Jet section (65.258N) in 5-7 days and to the Angmagssalik section (63.58N) in 2-3 weeks. Second, the dense water pathways on the continental shelf are consistent with observations and particles released on the shelf in the strait constitute a significant fraction of the dense water particles recorded at the Angmagssalik section within 60 days (;25\%). Some particles circulate on the shelf for several weeks before they spill off the shelf break and join the overflow from the sill. Third, there are two places where the water density following particle trajectories decreases rapidly due to intense mixing: to the southwest of the sill and southwest of the Kangerdlugssuaq Trough on the continental slope. After transformation in these places, the overflow particles exhibit a wide range of densities. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract  = {The major export route of dense water from the Nordic Seas into the North Atlantic is in the deep channel in Denmark Strait. Here currents have been monitored with one or two moored Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) since 1996. Volume transport estimates of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) so far were based on these data, which were regressed to the total transport of dense water in a numerical model. The resulting transport has been used in many publications. Here we present results from an extended five-mooring array deployed in 2014/2015, which included measurements outside the swift overflow core. This array provided the basis for new calculations to estimate the DSOW transports. Furthermore, a correction is proposed for biases detected on some ADCPs, which led to earlier underestimation of the flow in the lower part of the plume. Using the new method, the mean DSOW transport is estimated to be 3.2 Sv in the period 1996–2016, without a significant trend. Uncertainties are typically ±0.5 Sv. Beyond variations on the eddy scale, an empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) analysis of the velocity field reveals three dominant modes of variability: the first mode is roughly barotropic and corresponds to pulsations of the plume, the second mode represents the laterally shifting component of the plume's core position, and the third mode indicates the impact of the varying overflow thickness. Finally, DSOW transports are compared to the Faroe Bank Channel overflow transports, but no clear relationship is found.},

Some attempt is made to place this work in historical relation to similar efforts in radio-wave propagation through the ionosphere and light propagation through the atmosphere. It is emphasized that internal waves as a random medium possess several new features unfamiliar to those dealing with homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The effect of a background deterministic wave-speed variation (the ocean sound channel) is central to the theoretical treatment, which is based on a path-integral solution of the parabolic wave equation. A distinction is made between two sections of the saturated region, and some emphasis is placed on the region of partial saturation. Comparison with experiment is discussed with examples from the two-point mutual coherence function of time, frequency, and vertical separation; the intensity correlation in time, frequency, and vertical separation; the spectra of phase and log intensity, pulse propagation, and the higher moments of intensity.

  abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are rapidly changing due to human-caused global warming, rising sea level, changing circulation patterns, sea ice loss, and acidification that in turn alter the productivity and composition of marine biological communities. In addition, regional pressures associated with growing human populations and economies result in changes in infrastructure, land use, and other development; greater extraction of fisheries and other natural resources; alteration of benthic seascapes; increased pollution; and eutrophication. Understanding biodiversity is fundamental to assessing and managing human activities that sustain ecosystem health and services and mitigate humankind’s indiscretions. Remote-sensing observations provide rapid and synoptic data for assessing biophysical interactions at multiple spatial and temporal scales and thus are useful for monitoring biodiversity in critical coastal zones. However, many challenges remain because of complex bio-optical signals, poor signal retrieval, and suboptimal algorithms. Here, we highlight four approaches in remote sensing that complement the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON). MBON observations help quantify plankton functional types, foundation species, and unique species habitat relationships, as well as inform species distribution models. In concert with in situ observations across multiple platforms, these efforts contribute to monitoring biodiversity changes in complex coastal regions by providing oceanographic context, contributing to algorithm and indicator development, and creating linkages between long-term ecological studies, the next generations of satellite sensors, and marine ecosystem management.},

  abstract = {Understanding and management of the marine environment requires respect for, and inclusion of, Indigenous knowledge, cultures, and traditional practices. The Aha Honua, an ocean observing declaration from Coastal Indigenous Peoples, calls on the ocean observing community to “formally recognize the traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples,” and “to learn and respect each other’s ways of knowing.” Ocean observing systems typically adopt open data sharing as a core principle, often requiring that data be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Without modification, this approach to Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) would mean disregarding historical and ongoing injustices and imbalances in power, and information management principles designed to address these wrongs. Excluding TEK from global ocean observing is not equitable or desirable. Ocean observing systems tend to align with settler geography, but their chosen regions often include Indigenous coastal-dwelling communities that have acted as caretakers and stewards of the land and ocean for thousands of years. Achieving the call of Aha Honua will require building relationships that recognize Indigenous peoples play a special role in the area of ocean stewardship, care, and understanding. This review examines the current understanding of how Indigenous TEK can be successfully coordinated or utilized alongside western scientific systems, specifically the potential coordination of TEK with ocean observing systems. We identify relevant methods and collaborative projects, including cases where TEK has been collected, digitized and the meta(data) has been made open under some or all the FAIR principles. This review also highlights enabling factors that notably contribute to successful outcomes in digitization, and mitigation measures to avoid the decontextualization of TEK. Recommendations are primarily value- and process-based, rather than action-based, and acknowledge the key limitation that this review is based on extant written knowledge. In cases where examples are provided, or local context is necessary to be concrete, we refer to a motivating example of the nascent Atlantic Regional Association of the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System and their desire to build relationships with Indigenous communities.},

We present measurements of velocity, temperature, salinity, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, and thermal variance dissipation rate beneath Pine Island Glacier ice shelf, West Antarctica. These measurements were obtained by CTD, ADCP, and turbulence sensors mounted on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The highest turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate is found near the grounding line. The thermal variance dissipation rate increases closer to the ice-shelf base, with a maximum value found ∼0.5 m away from the ice. The measurements of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate near the ice are used to estimate basal melting of the ice shelf. The dissipation-rate-based melt rate estimates is sensitive to the stability correction parameter in the linear approximation of universal function of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for stratified boundary layers. We argue that our estimates of basal melting from dissipation rates are within a range of previous estimates of basal melting.},

Here, we compare two years, 2015 and 2017, the latter characterized by a much larger spatial extent of warmer, more saline Pacific waters within the study region. These environmental differences were associated with changes in the taxonomic diversity and species composition of eight different assemblages. Impacts included decreases in the diversity and abundance of benthic species and increases in the diversity and abundance of zooplankton and demersal fish. These observations are consistent with the expected patterns of borealization, a term that describes changes from polar to more southern or boreal conditions and that have been observed on other Arctic inflow shelves where there is communication with the global ocean. A decoupling of the seabird assemblage from other assemblages in 2017 suggests that seabirds were unable to fully adjust to changing prey conditions in 2017. Pronounced differences in the taxonomic composition and a substantial decline in taxonomic diversity of bacteria and protists in 2017 remain unexplained but suggest that these microbes are highly susceptible to changing conditions. Continued warming of the Chukchi Sea will likely result in further borealization, with differential impacts on pelagic and benthic communities.},

	abstract = {Recently, a new generation of global positioning system (GPS) collars has become available that provides limited daily location fixes, a relatively long battery life, and are low-cost, compared to full-featured GPS collars. However, their performance is untested, and assessing these biases is needed to inform study designs and data analysis protocols. We used stationary tests of 15 Lotek LifeCycle GPS collars-An example of low-feature GPS collars-To measure the accuracy of location fixes. In addition, we deployed Lotek Lifecycle GPS collars on 153 caribou Rangifer tarandus and 24 bison Bison bison in Yukon and Alaska, to assess their field performance. We examined differences among species, sex, location fix schedule, and latitude, on four performance metrics (FSR, 3D-V FSR, DOP and DSR). Stationary trials indicated that mean precision (4.3 ± 4.0 m [SD]) and accuracy (6.0 ± 4.7 m) of location fixes was excellent, and FSR was good (87.2\%), albeit both were slightly affected by forest canopy cover. Field performance varied by species and sex. Notably, the mean DSR for male bison was dismal (27.4 ± 24.2\%) likely because of their behaviour, and the mean FSR, 3DV-FSR and DOP, for male caribou was poor (FSR = 57.3 ± 2.0\%), compared to collars deployed on female caribou (72.2 ± 1.7\%) or female bison (77.9 ± 1.4\%). We also observed that the VHF transmitters often failed when the collar malfunctioned. Biases in the accuracy and performance of these low-cost GPS collars should be taken into account when designing studies. Researcher's contemplating investing in low-feature GPS collars require information on their 'real-world' performance so that they can decide whether they are appropriate for their intended application. Moreover, researchers need to consider biases in their GPS collar data prior to embarking on field studies and when conducting analyses with the data collected from them.},

	abstract = {Growing activity in the Arctic calls for high integrity navigation in this region. This can be achieved using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in conjunction with Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) or Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM). Single frequency GPS-only SBAS is in service in some regions today and is reliant on ground and space infrastructure. ARAIM will be more autonomous and will rely on the multitude of signals and core constellations coming in the future. Here, we examine both SBAS and ARAIM in the context of aviation and maritime requirements in the Arctic. Results demonstrate that the introduction of multi-frequency and multi-constellation to these systems enables navigation safety in the Arctic. SBAS brings aircraft precision approach as well as precise maritime operations such as mapping. ARAIM also supports precision approach in addition to autonomous ice navigation at sea but falls short of precision maritime requirements. Copyright © 2016 Institute of Navigation.},

  abstract = {This study analyses GPS performance in Yukon's Arctic coast to inform future research that uses this technology in the region. To test this, Telonics GPS collars were placed on stakes during the summers of 2009 and 2010 throughout the region for varying lengths of time. The fix records produced by these collars were then collected and cleaned, leaving 30 samples. Using these records combined with a digital elevation model, eight variables were extracted and analysed in an attempt to find relationships, such that a fix rate could be predicted throughout the landscape. The results indicated that very few strong relationships existed. Densiometer values proved to be the only relationship between an environmental variable and fix rate. Available sky and aspect data produced results that were contrary to those expected. Overall, Telonics Generation 3 collars had extremely high fix rates, high accuracy, and low positional dilution of precision. Moreover, there was little variation in these results. This means that future GPS studies in the region would likely require minimal correction for fix rate bias. However, if corrections were to be made, more data would have to be gathered to ensure the results were statistically sound. The analysis suffered from the limitations of small sample size and low sample variance, among several others. Therefore, future studies should increase the number and diversity of sites tested.},

A global-positioning-system ionospheric scintillation and TEC monitor (GISTM) receiver (model GSV4004A) was used to record scintillations and the total electron content (TEC). The polar ionosphere is more sensitive to phase than to amplitude scintillations. Occurrence of amplitude scintillation is confined to well-defined regions, while phase scintillation shows a strong characterization both in magnetic latitude and magnetic local time. Occurrence of amplitude and phase scintillation increases during disturbed compared with quiet days. During disturbed days, the phase-scintillation region is displaced towards lower latitudes, following the auroral oval. The observed noon peak in scintillation occurrence may indicate that the irregularities that generate scintillation are caused by precipitation in the daytime cusp/cleft region. A significant enhancement of the TEC and the rate of change of the TEC index (ROTI) signified transits of polar-cap patches across different satellite trajectories during geomagnetic storms. We found that patches are most likely to occur when IMF Bz is southward and/or Kp{\textgreater}4. Loss of signal lock was more for the L2 signal than for L1, and shows a maximum in the morning sector. Positional errors tend to increase during disturbed conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.},

While the timing, degree, and consequences of future climate change impacts remain uncertain, many changes are already underway in regions around the world, such as in the Arctic, and call for action by U.S. naval leadership in response.{\textbackslash}nThe terms of reference (TOR) directed that the study be based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and other peer-reviewed assessment. Therefore, the committee did not address the science of climate change or challenge the scenarios on which the committee's findings and recommendations are based. National Security Implications of Climate Change for U.S. Naval Forces addresses both the near- and long-term implications for U.S. naval forces in each of the four areas of the TOR, and provides corresponding findings and recommendations.

Exploration of this unique environment using standard remotely operated oceanographic tools has been obstructed by the dense Arctic ice cover.

Unlike previous research expeditions to the Arctic the focus was on high resolution imaging and sampling of the deep seafloor. To accomplish our goals we designed two new Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) named Jaguar and Puma, which performed a total of nine dives at depths of up to 4062m. These AUVs were used in combination with a towed vehicle and a conventional CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) program to characterize the seafloor.

The system operates at 900 Hz, and has programmable bandwidth, from 25 to 100 Hz. The communications data rate for the system is several bits per second, sufficient to transmit the GPS location of the buoys and several bytes of data to vehicles under the ice. The system was deployed in March of 2014 and operated through the fall of 2014, testing the performance of both the navigation and communications capabilities of the system in conjunction with Seagliders deployed by the University of Washington. Ranges of greater than 400 km were achieved with range accuracy of 40 m RMS for the case where the speed of sound is known.

The gliders recorded over 2000 broadband transmissions at ranges up to 700 km from moored acoustic sources as they transited between mooring sites. The precision of glider positioning at the time of acoustic reception is important to resolve the fundamental ambiguity between position and sound speed. The Seagliders utilized GPS at the surface and a kinematic model below for positioning. The gliders were typically underwater for about 6.4 h, diving to depths of 1000 m and traveling on average 3.6 km during a dive. Measured acoustic arrival peaks were unambiguously associated with predicted ray arrivals. Statistics of travel-time offsets between received arrivals and acoustic predictions were used to estimate range uncertainty. Range (travel time) uncertainty between the source and the glider position from the kinematic model is estimated to be 639 m (426 ms) rms. Least-squares solutions for glider position estimated from acoustically derived ranges from 5 sources differed by 914 m rms from modeled positions, with estimated uncertainty of 106 m rms in horizontal position.

The current OAT approach is shown to be a special case of the general framework. The matched-field tomography (MFT) approach is also discussed within this context. A simple implementation of this novel approach is then investigated in the absence of a suitable oceanographic model, and acoustic propagation is accounted for using a standard parabolic equation model. The inverse equations derived are validated numerically through a simple inversion example, and some issues on environmental mismatch and computations are discussed.

The goal of this work is to enable the task of navigating multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) over length scales of O(100 km), while maintaining error tolerances commensurate with conventional long-baseline transponder-based navigation systems (O(1 m)), but without the requisite need for deploying, calibrating, and recovering seafloor anchored acoustic transponders. Our navigation system is comprised of an acoustic modem-based communication/navigation system that allows for onboard navigational data to be broadcast as a data packet by a source node, and for all passively receiving nodes to be able to decode the data packet to obtain a one-way travel time pseudo-range measurement and ephemeris data. We present field results for a two-node configuration consisting of a surface ship acting as a global navigation aid to a Doppler-aided AUV. ©2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Pacific Arctic Region has experienced decadal changes in atmospheric conditions, seasonal sea-ice coverage, and thermohaline structure that have consequences for underwater sound propagation. To better understand Arctic acoustics, a set of experiments known as the deep-water Canada Basin acoustic propagation experiment and the shallow-water Canada Basin acoustic propagation experiment was conducted in the Canada Basin and on the Chukchi Shelf from summer 2016 to summer 2017. During the experiments, low-frequency signals from five tomographic sources located in the deep basin were recorded by an array of hydrophones located on the shelf. Over the course of the yearlong experiment, the surface conditions transitioned from completely open water to fully ice-covered. The propagation conditions in the deep basin were dominated by a subsurface duct; however, over the slope and shelf, the duct was seen to significantly weaken during the winter and spring. The combination of these surface and subsurface conditions led to changes in the received level of the sources that exceeded 60 dB and showed a distinct spacio-temporal dependence, which was correlated with the locations of the sources in the basin. This paper seeks to quantify the observed variability in the received signals through propagation modeling using spatially sparse environmental measurements.},

The data are from three days of the PhilSea10 experiment with a single fixed transmitter depth (∼998 m) and 150 receiver depths (∼210–5388 m) of known location, and a great-circle transmitter-receiver distance of ∼510 km. The proposed ranging methods compare observed acoustic records with synthetic records computed through the HYCOM (hybrid coordinate ocean model) model. More than 8900 transmissions over 3 days characterize the statistical variation of range errors. Reliable ranging methods de-emphasize the parts of the data records least likely to be reproduced by the synthetics, which include arrival amplitudes, the later parts of the acoustic records composed of nearly horizontally launched rays (i.e., the finale), and waves that sample a narrow span of ocean depths. The ranging methods proposed normalize amplitudes, measure travel times, or reject parts of the waveforms beyond a critical time. All deliver reliable range estimates based on the time and path-averaged HYCOM model, although the final method performs best. The principles behind these methods are transportable and expected to provide reliable range estimates in different deep water settings.},

In particular, small-scale mixing processes are necessary to resupply the potential energy removed in the interior by the overturning and eddy-generating process. A number of lines of evidence, none complete, suggest that the oceanic general circulation, far from being a heat engine, is almost wholly governed by the forcing of the wind field and secondarily by deep water tides. In detail however, the budget of mechanical energy input into the ocean is poorly constrained. The now inescapable conclusion that over most of the ocean significant "vertical" mixing is confined to topographically complex boundary areas implies a potentially radically different interior circulation than is possible with uniform mixing. Whether ocean circulation models, either simple box or full numerical ones, neither explicitly accounting for the energy input into the system nor providing for spatial variability in the mixing, have any physical relevance under changed climate conditions is at issue. © 2004 by Annual Reviews.

The surface layer consists of an energetic wave-affected thin zone at the very top and a law-of-the-wall layer right below, where the classical logarithmic-layer characteristic applies on average. Short-term current and dissipation profiles, however, deviate strongly from any steady state. In contrast, the quasi-steady bottom boundary layer behaves almost perfectly as a logarithmic layer, although periodic seiching modifies the structure in the details. The interior stratified turbulence is extremely weak, even though much of the mechanical energy is contained in baroclinic basin-scale seiching and Kelvin waves or inertial currents (large lakes). The transformation of large-scale motions to turbulence occurs mainly in the bottom boundary and not in the interior, where the local shear remains weak and the Richardson numbers are generally large.},

Comparing diffusivities from microstructure profiling with those inferred from the thickening rate of four simultaneous tracer releases has verified, within observational accuracy, 0.2 as the mixing coefficient over a 30-fold range of diapycnal diffusivities. Although some mixing coefficients can be estimated from pycnocline measurements, at present mixing efficiency must be obtained from channel flows, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations. Reviewing the different approaches demonstrates that estimates and parameterizations for mixing efficiency and coefficients are not converging beyond the at-sea comparisons with tracer releases, leading to recommendations for a community approach to address this important issue.},

	abstract = {Recent studies in lakes have shown evidence for a strong influence of shear-induced stratification on mixing in turbulent bottom boundary layers (BBLs) on sloping topography. These observations suggest that the periodic near-bottom shear resulting from internal wave motions may lead to alternating periods of gravitationally stable and unstable stratification in the BBL with relevant implications for turbulence and mixing in the entire basin. The impact of these processes for basin-scale mixing is investigated here in a three-dimensional processes-oriented modeling study, using a well-investigated system (Lake Alpnach, Switzerland) as an example. Consistent with available observations, our results indicate that the BBL becomes gravitationally unstable in areas with upslope flow, covering a substantial fraction of the total bottom area of the lake. While near-bottom convection associated with the unstable stratification in these areas results in strong turbulence, its contribution to net mixing is negligible since the BBL is already well mixed. Conversely, in areas with downslope flow the near-bottom shear generates stable stratification, leading to a suppression of turbulence but also to larger mixing rates due to an enhanced mixing efficiency. Overall, BBL mixing is found to dominate basin-scale mixing. These mechanisms are likely to be important for a large class of stratified natural waters, in which boundary layer mixing is energized by periodic internal waves or basin-scale motions.

  abstract = {A significant fraction of the lateral heat transport into the Labrador Sea's interior, needed to balance the net heat loss to the atmosphere, is attributed to the Irminger Current Anticyclones. These mesoscale eddies advect warm, salty boundary current water, of subtropical origin, from the boundary current to the interior-but when or how they release their anomalous heat content has not been previously investigated. In this study, we discuss the seasonal and interannual evolution of these anticyclones as inferred from the analysis of hydrographic data from the Labrador Sea from 1990 to 2004. The 29 identified anticyclones fall into two categories, which we refer to as unconvected and convected. Unconvected anticyclones have properties that are close to those of the boundary current, including a fresh surface layer, and they are found near the boundaries and never observed in winter. Convected anticyclones, on the other hand, contain a mixed layer, lack a freshwater cap and are observed throughout the year. Using a one-dimensional mixing model, it is shown that the convected eddies are those Irminger Current Anticyclones that have been modified by the large winter buoyancy loss of the region. This provides evidence that such eddies can survive the strong winter buoyancy loss in the Labrador Sea and that their anomalous heat and salt content is not trivially mixed into the Sea's interior. Finally, we observe a clear trend in the eddies' properties toward warmer and saltier conditions after 1997 reflecting changes in the source waters and the reduced atmospheric forcing over the Labrador Sea.},

Although Indigenous communities and their knowledge systems are recognized as critical resources for understanding and adapting to climate change, no comprehensive, evidence-based analysis has been conducted into how environmental studies engage Indigenous communities. Here we provide the first global systematic review of levels of Indigenous community participation and decision-making in all stages of the research process (initiation, design, implementation, analysis, dissemination) in climate field studies that access Indigenous knowledge. We develop indicators for assessing responsible community engagement in research practice and identify patterns in levels of Indigenous community engagement. We find that the vast majority of climate studies (87\%) practice an extractive model in which outside researchers use Indigenous knowledge systems with minimal participation or decision-making authority from communities who hold them. Few studies report on outputs that directly serve Indigenous communities, ethical guidelines for research practice, or providing Indigenous community access to findings. Further, studies initiated with (in mutual agreement between outside researchers and Indigenous communities) and by Indigenous community members report significantly more indicators for responsible community engagement when accessing Indigenous knowledges than studies initiated by outside researchers alone. This global assessment provides an evidence base to inform our understanding of broader social impacts related to research design and concludes with a series of guiding questions and methods to support responsible research practice with Indigenous and local communities.},

The proportion of women among geoscience faculty has been catalogued in previous studies but there has yet to be research considering the effects of institutional practices on the under-representation of women. Here, we compile a dataset of 2,531 tenured and tenure-track geoscience faculty from 62 universities to evaluate the proportion of women by rank, discipline, and type of institution. We find that 27\% of faculty are women. The fraction of women in the faculty pool decreases with rank, as women comprise 46\% of assistant professors, 34\% of associate professors, and 19\% of full professors. We quantify the attrition of women in terms of a fractionation factor, which describes the rate of loss of women along the tenure track and allows us to move away from the metaphor of the `leaky pipeline'. Given significant disparities in race, this work is most applicable to white women, and our use of the gender binary does not represent gender diversity in the geosciences. Our results support previous work that shows tackling the diversity problem at the student level is insufficient to ensure gender parity at the faculty level. Rather, efforts to address inequities in institutional culture and biases in promotion and hiring practices over the past few years may provide insight into the recent positive shifts in fractionation factor.},

For both salinity and temperature, hydrographic variability was present at all time scales that could be analysed, from multi-decadal to weekly. A mechanistic explanation for the primal cause of the hydrographic variability is still lacking. The direct cause of the observed variability has to be sought in variations of the properties of the source water types involved in the overflow across the sill in Denmark Strait, variations in the mutual ratios of these source water types, and in inhomogeneities in the DSOW layer. The strongest changes occurred at the longest time scales, as is often found for ultimately randomly forced geophysical time series. However, a significant annual cycle of the DSOW, not reported before, was observed at the foot of the East Greenland continental slope, likely a deterministic contribution to the hydrographic variability signal. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

These properties represent a typical salinity anomaly of 0.03 and a temperature anomaly of 0.28°C from noneddy values. All eddies had small (≪1) Rossby numbers. In 2006, the glider observed two anticyclones having diameters of about 20 km and peak azimuthal speeds of about 0.3 m s-1. Similar salinity anomalies were detected throughout the Irminger Sea by floats profiling in anticyclones. Two formation regions for the eddies are identified: one to the west of the Reykjanes Ridge and the other off the East Greenland Irminger Current near Cape Farewell close to the mooring. Observations indicate that eddies formed in the former region are larger than eddies observed at the mooring.Aclear increase in eddy salinity is observed between 2002 and 2009. The observed breakup of these eddies in winter implies that they are a source of salt for the central gyre. The anticyclones are similar to those found in both the Labrador Sea and Norwegian Sea, making them a ubiquitous feature of the subpolar North Atlantic basins. ©2013 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {Deep convection is a key process in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, but because it acts at small scales, it remains poorly resolved by climate models. The occurrence of deep convection depends on weak initial stratification and strong surface buoyancy forcing, conditions that are satisfied in only a few ocean basins. In 2014, one of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) global arrays was installed close to the Central Irminger Sea (CIS) and the Long-term Ocean Circulation Observations (LOCO) moorings in the central Irminger Sea. These programs’ six moorings are located in the center of an area of deep convection and are distributed within a 50 km radius, thus offering detailed insight into spatial differences during the strong convection events that occurred during the winters of 2014/2015 and 2015/2016. Deep mixed layers, down to approximately 1,600 m, formed during both winters. The properties of the convectively renewed water mass at each mooring converge to a common temperature and salinity before restratification sets in at the end of winter. The largest differences in onset (or timing) of convection and restratification are seen between the northernmost and southernmost moorings. High-resolution atmospheric reanalysis data show there is higher atmospheric forcing at the northernmost mooring due to a more favorable position with respect to the Greenland tip jet. Nevertheless, earlier onset, and more continuous cooling and deepening of mixed layers, occurs at the southernmost mooring, while convection at the northern mooring is frequently interrupted by warm events. We propose that these warm events are associated with eddies and filaments originating from the Irminger Current off the coast of Greenland and that convection further south benefits from cold inflow from the southwest.},

Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.},

Each of these vehicles uses an equirectangular map projection within their navigation systems, colloquially known as the AlvinXY coordinate scheme. Equirectangular projections provide a simple, affine mapping between geographic coordinates and the coordinates of a cartesian grid. Additionally, AlvinXY and similar coordinate systems disregard the effect of depth upon the coordinate mapping. Advances in underwater navigational instrumentation during the past forty years now allow localization to such precision that, in some cases, the precision of the navigation solution is comparable to that of errors introduced by working in this simple coordinate space. In this paper, we characterize the effects of projection errors in this system upon vehicle navigation and localization for deep oceanographic vehicles today. © 2010 IEEE.},

With this motivation, a high-frequency broadband scattering system has been developed for investigating zooplankton and microstructure, involving custom modifications of a commercially available system, with almost complete acoustic coverage spanning the frequency range 150-600 kHz. This frequency range spans the Rayleigh-to-geometric scattering transition for some zooplankton, as well as the diffusive roll-off in the spectrum for scattering from turbulent temperature microstructure. The system has been used to measure scattering from zooplankton and microstructure in regions of non-linear internal waves. The broadband capabilities of the system provide a continuous frequency response of the scattering over a wide frequency band, and improved range resolution and signal-to-noise ratios through pulse-compression signal-processing techniques. System specifications and calibration procedures are outlined and the system performance is assessed. The results point to the utility of high-frequency broadband scattering techniques in the detection, classification, and under certain circumstances, quantification of zooplankton and microstructure.},

These waves are ideal for assessing the contribution from oceanic microstructure to scattering as they are intensely turbulent. Almost coincident direct microstructure measurements were performed and zooplankton community structure was characterized using depth-resolved net sampling techniques. The contribution to scattering from microstructure can be difficult to distinguish from the contribution to scattering from zooplankton using a single narrowband frequency as microstructure and zooplankton are often colocated and can have similar scattering levels over a range of frequencies. Yet their spectra are distinct over a sufficiently broad frequency range, allowing broadband backscattering measurements to reduce the ambiguities typically associated with the interpretation of narrowband measurements. In addition, pulse compression signal processing techniques result in very high-resolution images, allowing physical processes that are otherwise hard to resolve to be imaged, such as KelvinHelmholtz shear instabilities. In this study, high-resolution acoustic observations of multiple nonlinear internal waves are presented and regions with distinct scattering spectra are identified. Spectra that decrease in level across the available frequency band were highly correlated to regions of intense turbulence and high stratification, and to KevinHelmholtz shear instabilities in particular. Spectra that increase in level across the available frequency band were consistent with scattering dominated by small zooplankton. Simple inversions for relevant microstructure parameters are presented. Limitations of, and improvements to, the broadband system and techniques utilized in this study are discussed. © 2005 IEEE.},

CDOs “serve as powerful integrating forces for diversity issues” and must have access to resources and other sources of power that enable them to encourage change. Finally, the authors list important characteristics of a CDO applicant, such as “technical mastery of diversity issues”, deep understanding of academia, political savvy and communication skills, and to be results-oriented.},

  abstract = {Songs produced by migrating whales were recorded off the coast of Queensland, Australia, over six consecutive weeks in 2003. Forty-eight independent song sessions were analyzed using information theory techniques. The average length of the songs estimated by correlation analysis was approximately 100 units, with song sessions lasting from 300 to over 3100 units. Song entropy, a measure of structural constraints, was estimated using three different methodologies: (1) the independently identically distributed model, (2) a first-order Markov model, and (3) the nonparametric sliding window match length (SWML) method, as described by Suzuki et al. [(2006). "Information entropy of humpback whale song," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 119, 1849-1866]. The analysis finds that the song sequences of migrating Australian whales are consistent with the hierarchical structure proposed by Payne and McVay [(1971). "Songs of humpback whales," Science 173, 587-597], and recently supported mathematically by Suzuki et al. (2006) for singers on the Hawaiian breeding grounds. Both the SWML entropy estimates and the song lengths for the Australian singers in 2003 were lower than that reported by Suzuki et al. (2006) for Hawaiian whales in 1976-1978; however, song redundancy did not differ between these two populations separated spatially and temporally. The average total information in the sequence of units in Australian song was approximately 35 bits/song. Aberrant songs (8\%) yielded entropies similar to the typical songs.},

	abstract = {Variabilities in the coastal ocean environment span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. From an acoustic viewpoint, the limited oceanographic measurements and today's ocean computational capabilities are not always able to provide oceanic-acoustic predictions in high-resolution and with enough accuracy. Adaptive Rapid Environmental Assessment (AREA) is an adaptive sampling concept being developed in connection with the emergence of Autonomous Ocean Sampling Networks and interdisciplinary ensemble predictions and adaptive sampling via Error Subspace Statistical Estimation (ESSE). By adaptively and optimally deploying in situ sampling resources and assimilating these data into coupled nested ocean and acoustic models, AREA can dramatically improve the estimation of ocean fields that matter for acoustic predictions. These concepts are outlined and a methodology is developed and illustrated based on the Focused Acoustic Forecasting-05 (FAF05) exercise in the northern Tyrrhenian sea. The methodology first couples the data-assimilative environmental and acoustic propagation ensemble modeling. An adaptive sampling plan is then predicted, using the uncertainty of the acoustic predictions as input to an optimization scheme which finds the parameter values of autonomous sampling behaviors that optimally reduce this forecast of the acoustic uncertainty. To compute this reduction, the expected statistics of unknown data to be sampled by different candidate sampling behaviors are assimilated. The predicted-optimal parameter values are then fed to the sampling vehicles. A second adaptation of these parameters is ultimately carried out in the water by the sampling vehicles using onboard routing, in response to the real ocean data that they acquire. The autonomy architecture and algorithms used to implement this methodology are also described. Results from a number of real-time AREA simulations using data collected during the Focused Acoustic Forecasting (FAF05) exercise are presented and discussed for the case of a single Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). For FAF05, the main AREA-ESSE application was the optimal tracking of the ocean thermocline based on ocean-acoustic ensemble prediction, adaptive sampling plans for vertical Yo-Yo behaviors and subsequent onboard Yo-Yo routing. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The possibility of exploiting low-resolution acoustic signals used for the navigation of Lagrangian floats to simultaneously estimate the speed of sound is studied. Acoustic navigation of Lagrangian floats is regularly carried out by measuring travel times from three fixed stations assuming a known value for the speed of sound. The sound speed is considered here as a variable of the problem to be estimated from the travel-time data simultaneously with the horizontal location of the float. The estimation problem is linearized and solved analytically, and closed-form expressions for the sound-speed estimation errors are derived. Typical acoustic navigation (RAFOS) signals are characterized by limited time resolution (0.2 s) challenging the accuracy of sound-speed estimation, depending on the location of the float with respect to the fixed stations. By exploiting travel-time data from multiple floats, the sound-speed estimation accuracy can be increased, which reflects in higher localization accuracy as well. In the case of a single float improved sound-speed estimates and localization results can be obtained by combining travel-time data from different float locations. Numerical results verify the theoretical error estimates and demonstrate the efficiency of the method.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of monitoring ocean basins for mesoscale fluctuations, using acoustic inverse techniques. The procedure, which has much in common with conventional seismology, consists of measuring perturbations in travel time between acoustic sources and receivers. Because the number of pieces of information is the product of the number of sources, receivers, and resolvable multipath arrivals, the economics of the system is enhanced over usual spot measurements. The temporal resolution required to distinguish multipath arrivals is estimated at 50 ms; the precision required to measure mesosclae perturbations is estimated at 25 ms. The required resolution and precision can be achieved by existing low-frequency (100- to 200-Hz) broadband ({\textgreater} 20-Hz) sources, but we are ultimately limited to 1000-km ranges by the variable ocean finestructure and associated micropaths. There appear to be no practical range limits imposed by micropaths if such broadband sources could be centered at 30 Hz. Given the travel time measurements and their noise estimates, we show how actually to invert the system for the interior changes in sound speed and, by inference, for density. The method is analogous to the medical procedure called tomography (from the Greek 'slice'). Measures of the spatial resolution and of formal error bars are obtained. We conclude that such a system is achievable now and has potential for development in a number of directions. © 1979.},

Simulation results show that the proposed method performs faster and more accurately than traditional methods. Field trial results show that the reversed RMSE of localization can be improved from 5.02 m to 2.35 m using the proposed method, where GPS outputs serve as true values to evaluate the localization performance.

  abstract = {To provide constraints on their inversion, ocean sound speed profiles (SSPs) often are modeled using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). However, this regularization, which uses the leading order EOFs with a minimum-energy constraint on their coefficients, often yields low resolution SSP estimates. In this paper, it is shown that dictionary learning, a form of unsupervised machine learning, can improve SSP resolution by generating a dictionary of shape functions for sparse processing (e.g. compressive sensing) that optimally compress SSPs; both minimizing the reconstruction error and the number of coefficients. These learned dictionaries (LDs) are not constrained to be orthogonal and thus, fit the given signals such that each signal example is approximated using few LD entries. Here, LDs describing SSP observations from the HF-97 experiment and the South China Sea are generated using the K-SVD algorithm. These LDs better explain SSP variability and require fewer coefficients than EOFs, describing much of the variability with one coefficient. Thus, LDs improve the resolution of SSP estimates with negligible computational burden.},

The song is an ordered sequence of individual sound elements separated by gaps of silence. Song samples were converted into sequences of discrete symbols by both human and automated classifiers. This paper analyzes the song structure in these symbol sequences using information entropy estimators and autocorrelation estimators. Both parametric and nonparametric entropy estimators are applied to the symbol sequences representing the songs. The results provide quantitative evidence consistent with the hierarchical structure proposed for these songs by Payne and McVay [Science 173, 587-597 (1971)]. Specifically, this analysis demonstrates that: (1) There is a strong structural constraint, or syntax, in the generation of the songs, and (2) the structural constraints exhibit periodicities with periods of 6-8 and 180-400 units. This implies that no empirical Markov model is capable of representing the songs' structure. The results are robust to the choice of either human or automated song-to-symbol classifiers. In addition, the entropy estimates indicate that the maximum amount of information that could be communicated by the sequence of sounds made is less than 1 bit per second.},

The acoustic frequencies used span 120-600 kHz, which, for the highly stratified and dynamic estuarine environment, correspond to wavenumbers in the viscous-convective subrange (500-2500 m(-1)). The acoustically measured spectral levels are in close agreement with spectral levels measured with closely co-located micro-conductivity probes. The acoustically measured spectral shapes allow discrimination between scattering dominated by turbulent salinity microstructure and suspended sediments or swim-bladdered fish, the two primary sources of scattering observed in the estuary in addition to turbulent salinity microstructure. The direct comparison of salinity spectra inferred acoustically and by the in situ turbulence sensors provides a test of both the acoustic scattering model and the quantitative skill of acoustical remote sensing of turbulence dissipation in a strongly sheared and salt-stratified estuary.},

  abstract = {© 2017 Acoustical Society of America. This paper investigates the applicability of a ray-based blind deconvolution (RBD) method for underwater acoustic sources of opportunity such as ships recorded on a receiver array. The RBD relies on first estimating the unknown phase of the random source by beamforming along a well-resolved ray path, and then matched-filtering each received signal using the knowledge of this random phase to estimate the full channel impulse responses (CIRs) between the unknown source and the array elements (up to an arbitrary time-shift) as well as recovering the radiated signal by the random source. The performance of this RBD is investigated using both numerical simulation and experimental recordings of shipping noise in the frequency band [300-800 Hz] for ranges up to several kilometers. The ray amplitudes of the estimated CIRs are shown to be consistent with known bottom properties in the area. Furthermore, CIRs obtained for an arbitrarily selected shipping track are used as data-derived replicas to perform broadband matched-field processing to locate another shipping source recorded at a later time in the vicinity of the selected track.},

  abstract = {A new approach based on statistical estimation is proposed for the analysis of tomographic traveltime data in cases of significant nonlinear dependence of the traveltimes on the sound-speed variations. Traditional tomography schemes based on linear perturbative inversions about a single, a priori fixed background state cannot properly handle such cases since the linearized model relations will lead to considerable inversion errors, depending on the extent of nonlinearity. In contrast, the background state is considered here as a variable unknown quantity to be estimated from the traveltime data, simultaneously with the peak identification function and the sound-speed perturbation. Using the maximum likelihood approach and the Gaussian assumption, the statistical estimation problem reduces to a weighted least squares problem to be solved simultaneously for the three unknown quantities. A posteriori inversion-error estimates are derived accounting also for uncertainties in the background selection and the peak identification. The proposed method is applied to nine-month-long traveltime data from the Thetis-2 experiment, conducted from January to October 1994 in the Western Mediterranean Sea, where the variability of the ocean environment gives rise to significant nonlinear dependencies between sound-speed and traveltime variations. The recovered temporal variability and stratification compare well with independent XBT observations.},

In other words, it solves the problem of associating TDOAs to whales. The algorithm is able to resolve association disputes where a given TDOA measurement may fit to more than one position estimate and can handle spurious TDOAs. The algorithm also provides estimates of Cramer-Rao lower bound for the position estimates. The algorithm was tested with real data using TDOA estimates obtained by cross-correlating click-trains. The click-trains were generated by a separate algorithm that operated independently on each sensor to produce click-trains corresponding to a given whale and to reject click-trains from reflected propagation paths.},

We demonstrate how to combine and correlate marine data from autonomous underwater vehicles, model forecasts, remote sensing satellite, buoy, and ship-based measurements, as a means to cross-validate and improve ocean model accuracy, in addition to resolving upper water-column interactions. Our work is focused on the west coast of Mid-Norway where significant influx of Atlantic Water produces a rich and complex physical–biological coupling, which is hard to measure and characterize due to the harsh environmental conditions.

  abstract = {In a recent experiment (The Ocean Tomography Group, Nature, 299, 121-125, 1982) the sound-speed field (and hence temperature) within an ocean volume was computed from acoustic travel times through the volume along many diverse ray paths, using inverse theory. Here we consider the limits on vertical resolution imposed by the fundamental character of the ocean sound channel. For a standard case we take an axial transmitter and receiver separated by 1000 km, with layers determined by the turning depths of double-looped rays. This gives an underdetermined system of 10 layers and six rays, with a forbidding up-down ambiguity between 'conjugate' layers (two layers with equal sound speed above and beneath the sound axis). The ambiguity can be reduced (but not eliminated) by including rays with an extra upper (or lower) loop, and can be removed by going to a coarse vertical grid. The results apply to the 'agnostic' case where nothing is prescribed; if it can be assumed that the disturbances are N(z) weighted according to WKBJ theory, then the standard 10-layer case is adequately resolved in the upper and axial ocean. If one can prescribe that the disturbance is associated with only the gravest few modes (as found during the MODE expedition), then the results are favourable at all depths. We consider tomography with reciprocal transmissions for obtaining the fields of both particle velocity and sound speed, and we assume that the density perturbations are adequately determined by the sound field using an average T-S relation. The thermal-wind equation relates the vertical velocity gradient to the horizontal density gradient and can be used to impose a constraint on the inversion process, which significantly improves the determination of both fields. The procedure leads to a formalism for objectively separating barotropic and baroclinic velocity fields. © 1982.},

  abstract = {Equations are derived for analyzing the performance of channel estimate based equalizers. The performance is characterized in terms of the mean squared soft decision error (sigma2(s)) of each equalizer. This error is decomposed into two components. These are the minimum achievable error (sigma2(0)) and the excess error (sigma2(e)). The former is the soft decision error that would be realized by the equalizer if the filter coefficient calculation were based upon perfect knowledge of the channel impulse response and statistics of the interfering noise field. The latter is the additional soft decision error that is realized due to errors in the estimates of these channel parameters. These expressions accurately predict the equalizer errors observed in the processing of experimental data by a channel estimate based decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and a passive time-reversal equalizer. Further expressions are presented that allow equalizer performance to be predicted given the scattering function of the acoustic channel. The analysis using these expressions yields insights into the features of surface scattering that most significantly impact equalizer performance in shallow water environments and motivates the implementation of a DFE that is robust with respect to channel estimation errors.},

They represent the only means to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic forcings, and are the best tools to explore causal links and implications for human communities that depend on ocean resources. Since the inception of sustained ocean observations, ocean time series have withstood many challenges, most prominently availability of uninterrupted funding and retention of trained personnel. This OceanObs'19 review article provides an overarching vision for sustained ocean time series observations for the next decade, focusing on the growing challenges of maintaining sustained ocean time series, including ship-based and autonomous coastal and open-ocean platforms, as well as remote sensing. In addition to increased diversification of funding sources to include the private sector, NGOs, and other groups, more effective engagement of stakeholders and other end-users will be critical to ensure the sustainability of ocean time series programs. Building a cohesive international time series network will require dedicated capacity to coordinate across observing programs and leverage existing infrastructure and platforms of opportunity. This review article outlines near-term observing priorities and technology needs; explores potential mechanisms to broaden ocean time series data applications and end-user communities; and describes current tools and future requirements for managing increasingly complex multi-platform data streams and developing synthesis products that support science and society. The actionable recommendations outlined herein ultimately form the basis for a robust, sustainable, fit-for-purpose time series network that will foster a predictive understanding of changing ocean systems for the benefit of society.},

Four years of mooring data from the eastern Labrador Sea reveal persistent mesoscale variability in the West Greenland boundary current. Between 2014 and 2018, 197 middepth intensified cyclones were identified that passed the array near the 2000-m isobath. In this study, we quantify these features and show that they are the downstream manifestation of Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) cyclones. A composite cyclone is constructed revealing an average radius of 9 km, maximum azimuthal speed of 24 cm s-1, and a core propagation velocity of 27 cm s-1.Thecore propagation velocity is significantly smaller than upstream near Denmark Strait, allowing them to trap more water. The cyclones transport a 200-m-thick lens of dense water at the bottom of the water column and increase the transport of DSOW in the West Greenland boundary current by 17\% relative to the background flow. Only a portion of the features generated at Denmark Strait make it to the Labrador Sea, implying that the remainder are shed into the interior Irminger Sea, are retroflected at Cape Farewell, or dissipate. A synoptic shipboard survey east of Cape Farewell, conducted in summer 2020, captured two of these features that shed further light on their structure and timing. This is the first time DSOW cyclones have been observed in the Labrador Sea—a discovery that could have important implications for interior stratification.},

Addressing these problems leads to a substitution of the GM parameters E (nondimensional energy), b (vertical length scale), and No, (buoyancy frequency scale) with two new dimensional scales: Eref, the energy per unit mass, and D(w), the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB)- scaled thickness of the vertical waveguide.

Because acoustic propagation is best supported at low frequencies, although the total available bandwidth may be low, an acoustic communication system is inherently wideband in the sense that the bandwidth is not negligible with respect to its center frequency. The channel can have a sparse impulse response, where each physical path acts as a time-varying low-pass filter, and motion introduces additional Doppler spreading and shifting. Surface waves, internal turbulence, fluctuations in the sound speed, and other small-scale phenomena contribute to random signal variations. At this time, there are no standardized models for the acoustic channel fading, and experimental measurements are often made to assess the statistical properties of the channel in particular deployment sites. © 2009, IEEE.},

A Pressure-sensor equipped Inverted Echo Sounder (PIES) was deployed mid-fjord in Sermilik Fjord in southeast Greenland from August 2011 to September 2012 alongside a moored array of instruments recording temperature, conductivity and velocity. Historical hydrography is used to quantify the relationship between acoustic travel time and the vertically-averaged heat content, and a new method is developed for filtering acoustic return echoes in an ice-influenced environment. We show that PIES measurements, combined with a knowledge of the fjord’s two-layer density structure, can be used to reconstruct the thickness and temperature of the inflowing water. Additionally, we find that fjord-shelf exchange events are identifiable in the travel time record implying the PIES can be used to monitor fjord circulation. Finally, we show that PIES data can be combined with moored temperature records to derive the heat content of the upper layer of the fjord where moored instruments are at great risk of being damaged by transiting icebergs.},

	abstract = {In the underwater environment, spatiotemporally dynamic environmental conditions pose challenges to the detection and tracking of hydrographic features. A useful tool in combating these challenge is Autonomous Adaptive Environmental Assessment (AAEA) employed on board Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). AAEA is a process by which an AUV autonomously assesses the hydrographic environment it is swimming through in real-time, effectively detecting hydrographic features in the area. This feature detection process leads naturally to the subsequent active/adaptive tracking of a selected feature. Due to certain restrictions in operating AUVs this detection-tracking feedback loop setup with AAEA can only rely on having an AUV's self-collected hydrographic data (e.g., temperature, conductivity, and/or pressure readings) available. With a basic quantitative definition of an underwater feature of interest, an algorithm can be developed (with which a data set is evaluated) to detect said feature. One example of feature tracking with AAEA explored in this paper is tracking the marine thermocline. The AAEA process for thermocline tracking is outlined here from quantitatively defining the thermocline region and calculating thermal gradients, all the way through simulation and implementation of the process on AUVs. Adaptation to varying feature properties, scales, and other challenges in bringing the concept of feature tracking with AAEA into implementation in field experiments is addressed, and results from two recent field experiments are presented. © 2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The underwater environment severely constrains robotic navigation and communications, making the use of traditional multi-robot control and coordination schemes very difficult. These challenges are further exacerbated on a new generation of low-cost autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that lack a Doppler velocity log (DVL), acoustic modem or high-end inertial sensors typically used for underwater robotic navigation and communications. This work demonstrates multi-robot operations for low-cost AUVs via a novel and user-friendly operating paradigm that allows intuitive command and control of an AUV group. Each vehicle is equipped with a low-power and inexpensive acoustic system that enables it to navigate and receive operator commands. This system consists of a passive array of hydrophones and a timed acquisition and data processing stack that allows each AUV to self-localize relative to a single time-synchronized acoustic beacon. Switching between different operational 'modes' on the beacon causes it to broadcast different acoustic signals which, when received by the AUVs, result in the vehicles switching between different autonomous behaviors. These behaviors are defined in a beacon-centric coordinate system using pre-defined parameters unique to each vehicle; as a result, the movement of the beacon itself allows the operator to control the group-wide movement of all vehicles concurrently. This work presents field experiments with three SandShark AUVs in which the beacon and operator are collocated on a motorboat, allowing both operational mode and beacon movement to be controlled manually. However, by installing the beacon on a conventional mid or large-size AUV or autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), this paradigm provides a method for the remote command and control of an arbitrarily large number of miniature, low-cost AUVs, without the need for sophisticated navigational sensors or acoustic modems.},

Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) have long been seen as a game changer in the exploration and exploitation of the marine environment. Repeated access to remote and hazardous places for data gathering and intervention, enabled by their autonomy, is the key to their adoption. While historically the focus has been on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have recently been developed and adopted at an increasing rate. Interestingly, whereas AMVs (AUVs and USVs) have now been adopted in niche areas (bathymetric surveys and mine countermeasures), they have not yet hit the mainstream. In this article, we review the state of the art in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), which include ROVs and AUVs; current obstacles to their adoption, both technical and commercial; and recent advances in technology. We also present an outlook on the future of these systems.},

	abstract = {Dye release experiments were performed together with microstructure profiling to compare the two methods of estimating diapycnal diffusivity during summer and fall stratification on the continental shelf south of New England. The experiments were done in 1996 and 1997 as part of the Coastal Mixing and Optics Experiment. During the 100 hours or so of the experiments the area of the dye patches grew from less than 1 km 2 to more than 50 km2 [Sundermeyer and Ledwell, 2001]. Diapycnal diffusivities inferred from dye dispersion range from 10-6 to 10-5 m2/s at buoyancy frequencies from 9 to 28 cycles/hour. Diffusivities estimated from the dye and those estimated from dissipation rates in the companion paper by Oakey and Greenan [2004] agree closely in most cases. Estimates of diffusivities from towed conductivity microstructure measurements made during the cruises by Duda and Rehmann [2002] and Rehmann and Duda [2000] are fairly consistent with the dye diffusivities. The dye diffusivities would be predicted well by an empirical formula involving shear and stratification statistics developed by MacKinnon and Gregg [2003] from profiling microstructure measurements obtained at the same site in August 1996. All of the measurements support the general conclusion that the diffusivity, averaged over several days, is seldom greater than 10-5 m2/s in the stratified waters at the site, and usually not much greater than 10-6 m 2/s. Severe storms, such as a hurricane that passed over the CMO site in 1996, can dramatically increase the mixing at the site, however. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

As microstructure observations are sparse, these are supplemented with indirect measurements of mixing obtained from(i) Thorpe-scale overturns frommoored profilers, a finescale parameterization applied to (ii) shipboard observations of upper-ocean shear, (iii) strain as measured by profiling floats, and (iv) shear and strain from full-depth lowered acousticDoppler current profilers (LADCP) and CTDprofiles.Vertical profiles of the turbulent dissipation rate are bottom enhanced over rough topography and abrupt, isolated ridges. The geography of depth-integrated dissipation rate shows spatial variability related to internal wave generation, suggesting one direct energy pathway to turbulence. The global-averaged diapycnal diffusivity below 1000-m depth is O(10-4)m2 s-1 and above 1000-m depth is O(10-5)m2 s-1. The compiled microstructure observations sample a wide range of internal wave power inputs and topographic roughness, providing a dataset with which to estimate a representative global-averaged dissipation rate and diffusivity. However, there is strong regional variability in the ratio between local internal wave generation and local dissipation. In some regions, the depthintegrated dissipation rate is comparable to the estimated power input into the local internal wave field. In a few cases, more internal wave power is dissipated than locally generated, suggesting remote internal wave sources. However, atmost locations the total power lost through turbulent dissipation is less than the input into the local internal wave field. This suggests dissipation elsewhere, such as continental margins. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {The steady flow in and near a turbulent boundary layer on a sloping boundary is considered, for a nonrotating stratified fluid. It is shown that the effect of nonuniform stratification in the interior (i.e., away from the turbulent layer) is to induce a convergent-divergent flow in the boundary layer which results in an inflow or outflow to the interior. This inflow-outflow acts in a divergent-convergent manner on the interior isopycnals. Use of a filling-box argument for the slow time variation of the interior then produces an approximate expression for an effective interior vertical diffusivity. The parameter dependence of this diffusivity is very strong; however, with realistic geophysical values (subject to the omission of rotation), e.g., a mixed layer depth of 50 m, Munk's canonical value of 10 "SUP -4" m "SUP 2" s "SUP -1" can easily be achieved. This work thus supports the view that boundary mixing is likely to be an important process in setting the vertical density profile in the ocean. (A)},

Hydrographic (temperature and salinity) and velocity time series from three multiple-mooring arrays at the Denmark Strait sill, at 180 km downstream (south of Dohrn Bank) and at a further 320 km downstream on the east Greenland continental slope near Tasiilaq (formerly Angmagssalik), were analyzed to quantify the variability and track anomalies in DSOW in the period 2007–2012. No long-term trends were detected in the time series, while variability on time scales from interannual to weekly was present at all moorings. The hydrographic time series from different moorings within each mooring array showed coherent signals, while the velocity fluctuations were only weakly correlated. Lagged correlations of anomalies between the arrays revealed a propagation from the sill of Denmark Strait to the Angmagssalik array in potential temperature with an average propagation time of 13 days, while the correlations in salinity were low. Entrainment of warm and saline Atlantic Water and fresher water from the East Greenland Current (via the East Greenland Spill Jet) can explain the whole range of hydrographic changes in the DSOW measured downstream of the sill. Changes in the entrained water masses and in the mixing ratio can thus strongly influence the salinity variability of DSOW. Fresh anomalies found in downstream measurements of DSOW within the Deep Western Boundary Current can therefore not be attributed to Arctic climate variability in a straightforward way.},

In this talk, acoustic propagation from the Canadian Basin to the Alaskan Beaufort Shelf is modeled using measurements of physical oceanography and sea ice. Water masses that impact acoustic propagation and stratification in the basin include the warm, saline Atlantic Water (AW), which is overlain by cooler, lesssaline Pacific Winter Water (PWW). Oceanographic observations reveal intrusions of a warmer, fresher water mass called Pacific Summer Water (PSW). This water mass resides below the surface mixed layer, but above the PWW and reduces acoustic interaction with the sea-ice canopy for source depths located in the halocline duct. Oceanographic data indicate that on the continental shelf, the PSW intrusion can be absent in the ice-covered months resulting in an upward refracting sound speed profile. Using measurements from ice-tethered profilers in the basin and oceanographic moorings on the shelf, we model the temporal and spatial variability of the acoustic field. The effect of scattering from the ice cover is included, with consideration given to the seasonal variability of sea-ice concentration, thickness, and acoustic properties.},

  abstract = {BELLHOP is a beam tracing model for predicting acoustic pres- sure fields in ocean environments. The beam tracing structure leads to a particularly simple algorithm. Several types of beams are imple- mented including Gaussian and hat-shaped beams, with both geomet- ric and physics-based spreading laws. BELLHOP can produce a vari- ety of useful outputs including transmission loss, eigenrays, arrivals, and received time-series. It allows for range-dependence in the top and bottom boundaries (altimetry and bathymetry), as well as in the sound speed profile. Additional input files allow the specification of directional sources as well as geoacoustic properties for the bounding media. Top and bottom reflection coefficients may also be provided. BELLHOP is implemented in Fortran,Matlab, and Python and used on multiple platforms (Mac, Windows, and Linux). This report describes the code and illustrates its use. 1},

  abstract  = {Complex vehicle missions (such as under-ice operations) require balancing the various competing uses of the acoustic channel. We present an integrated communications and navigation system, where a single synchronized digital communication packet is used to both provide tracking and data to the operator. In response, a navigation correction is telemetered to the vehicle. This system was deployed and operating during the ICEX20 experiment in the Beaufort Sea in March 2020.},
