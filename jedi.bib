  annote  = {Bear et al. investigated how gender composition affects corporate social responsibility ratings (CSR) and firm reputation within top ranked companies in the healthcare industry. CSR was measured by KLD ratings, and is defined by based on both institutional strength and technical strength. Institutional strength is a collection of positive actions directed towards the community, and includes volunteer programs, charitable giving, and inclusive hiring practices. Technical strength includes actions directed towards employers and stakeholders. It includes benefits packages, safety programs, and transparency in reporting environmental and social impacts. CSR can, in turn, bolster a company's reputation by building its credibility and mitigating potential future reputational damage. Indeed, the study showed that the number of females on a board was positively associated with higher CSR ratings, and that this mediated a higher corporate reputation. Authors posited that a larger number of females may increase sensitivity, encourage more participative decision-making, and act as a signal that the firm is socially responsible. Authors also highlight how it may not be enough to have single female director; a “token” female's opinions may not be readily heard by the group, or easily expressed in a board where conformity is encouraged. On the other hand, a group of females may be more willing to express their ideas and exhibit collaborative decision making.},

To that end, the diversity officer must answer to senior officials, should have quantifiable goals and reasonable expectations, and must receive support in the form of time and resources. In return the institution must set an example by engaging faculty, increasing diversity in the administration, focusing on fixing the system rather than the people, and focusing on the values of love, authenticity, courage, and empathy (LACE).},

We study this question in the context of teachers' bias in grading immigrants and native children in middle schools. Teachers give lower grades to immigrant students compared to natives who have the same performance on standardized, blindly-graded tests. We then relate differences in grading to teachers' stereotypes, elicited through an Implicit Association Test (IAT). We find that math teachers with stronger stereotypes give lower grades to immigrants compared to natives with the same performance. Literature teachers do not differentially grade immigrants based on their own stereotypes. Finally, we share teachers' own IAT score with them, randomizing the timing of disclosure around the date on which they assign term grades. All teachers informed of their stereotypes before term grading increase grades assigned to immigrants. Revealing stereotypes may be a powerful intervention to decrease discrimination, but it may also induce a reaction from individuals who were not acting in a biased way.},

In this commentary article for Nature Geoscience, Rachel Bernard and Emily Cooperdock collected data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates about PhDs awarded to U.S. citizens and permanent residents in the geosciences (earth, atmospheric, and oceanic) since 1973. They found that gender diversity has improved since 1973, with women receiving about half of science PhDs in 2016 and female representation in geoscience faculty increasing from 14\% to 20\% since 2006. Ethnic diversity, however, has stagnated: there has been no increase in the percentage of PhDs that are awarded to Underrepresented Minorities (URMs) since 1973, while their percentage in the U.S. population has grown. In 2016, URMs (including Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans) received a combined 6\% of geoscience PhDs, despite comprising 31\% of the American population. The authors suggest strategies to combat this inequality, such as diversity fellowships, the use of Master's as a gateway to a PhD, increased encouragement for community outreach during thesis research, and additional funding for URMs to attend conferences.},

However, this opportunity cost is greater for some groups than others and is particularly burdensome for those who already have debt.

However, it is unclear how successful this strategy is. Specifically, the geosciences have been less successful than other sciences at recruiting a diverse workforce that reflects different perspectives and life experiences. Here we present a survey of students enrolled in College Algebra at a Hispanic-serving institution in the southwestern United States where, of 1550 students surveyed, 55.3\% identified as an underrepresented minority (URM). We find that surveyed students care little about working outdoors. Instead, they rate altruistic factors, such as helping people or the environment, as most important. Female respondents rate these factors higher than male respondents. We also find that many respondents know little about what a career in geoscience entails. We argue that better informing students about the altruistic potential of geoscience careers would be an effective strategy to broaden recruitment. The prospect of working outdoors, which has commonly been emphasized in geoscience recruitment, is less attractive to students than altruistic factors when considering future career paths, according to a survey of students in a diverse southwestern US college.},

Advancing social equity in marine conservation requires directing attention to: recognition through acknowledgment and respect for diverse peoples and perspectives; fair distribution of impacts through maximizing benefits and minimizing burdens; procedures through fostering participation in decision-making and good governance; management through championing and supporting local involvement and leadership; the environment through ensuring the efficacy of conservation actions and adequacy of management to ensure benefits to nature and people; and the structural barriers to and institutional roots of inequity in conservation. We then discuss the role of various conservation organizations in advancing social equity in marine conservation and identify the capacities these organizations need to build. We urge the marine conservation community, including governments, non-governmental organizations and donors, to commit to the pursuit of socially equitable conservation.},

A variety of cluster hire programs were sampled, ranging from those funded by their departments to those funded by outside sources, and from those with distinct management structures to those with little management. The study found that cluster hiring increased racial, gender, and ethnic diversity even when that wasn't the intended outcome, and that programs with cluster hiring had increased retention.

Larger teams have larger networks of colleagues, which may increase the visibility and ultimately, the citation number for a paper. In contrast, increasing time size has an inverted “u-shaped” relationship with novelty, with an intermediate number of co-authors being associated with the highest novelty scores as assessed by rarity of co-cited papers in the bibliography. The effect on novelty was primarily driven by the higher knowledge diversity brought by larger teams. While larger teams can increase the knowledge available, and have a larger pool of resources, they can also suffer from “process loss” due to lower consensus, more conflicts, and higher coordination costs. Authors of this study encourage developing more interdisciplinary teams, but caution that there is a size threshold where a large team could reduce novelty.

The authors clarify that, while some studies have found correlations between individual diversity and functional diversity, their model only applies to functional diversity: the variety of skills the individuals bring to a group. The mathematical model shows that, in the limit as a group becomes very large, the highest performing individuals necessarily become less functionally diverse. Thus, a group of randomly selected individuals from the entire group (so long as the individuals in the group are capable) will necessarily have larger functional diversity and outperforming a group of the highest performing individuals.},

Holistic applications are increasingly viewed as a means of addressing diversity issues, because traditional standards of success such as GPAs and test scores have been shown to disadvantage students from underrepresented minorities. From the summary, it is apparent that these changes are still in the fledgling stage, and that more work needs to be done to find best practices.},

To combat this, the diversity focus needs to come from the top down (including deans, provosts, and presidents), responsibility should be shared across several individuals or groups, and diversity offices should focus on doing a few tasks well, or risk doing many tasks poorly.},

This assumes that knowledge and governance are separate and gives knowledge co-production the appearance of playing an informative and facilitative role in global environmental change governance. But seeking Indigenous knowledge to inform environmental decision-making implies that Indigenous peoples are stakeholders as opposed to self-determining nations with rights and responsibilities regarding their knowledge systems and lands. Indigenous sovereignty is not respected when knowledge is treated as mere data for collective decision-making. This paper brings literatures on knowledge co-production together with Indigenous knowledge, research, and environmental governance to explain why co-production scholars must move away from seeking to better ‘integrate’ Indigenous knowledges into western science and make way for Indigenous research leadership.},

Self efficacy (intellectual confidence, competitiveness, and academic ability), along with academic skills (general knowledge, problem solving ability, critical thinking skills, and writing skills) were self-reported by students. Racial diversity, was assessed in three categories: 1) structural diversity (racial/ethnic diversity of the student body), 2) curricular/co-curricular diversity (institutionally run efforts to expose students to diversity), and 3) interaction diversity (informal interactions of people of different races). Using hierarchical linear modeling, the authors were able to assess the effects of diversity at the level of individual students and at the level of institutions. The study found that students who had higher involvement in diversity initiatives and who had more cross-cultural interactions reported higher levels of self-efficacy and higher general academic scores. Strikingly, authors also found institution-wide gains – students at institutions that had more diversity initiatives also had higher self-reported academic skills and a greater ability to get along with students of other races. This effect was found regardless of an individual student's involvement in the campus diversity initiatives. While authors find no statistically significant effect of structural diversity ob student outcomes, they caution that it is too early to conclude that student body racial composition does not affect academic outcomes. In fact, they argue it is likely that the student body racial composition may affect the other racial diversity dimensions (cross-cultural exchanges and student body involvement in racial diversity issues). Overall, authors conclude that institutions that embrace diversity create positive educational benefits for all their students. Authors also call for more studies on looking particularly at the impacts of racial diversity on the level of school staff in shaping academic achievement.},

Indicating systematic advantages accompanying WAHM status, WAHM experience more social inclusion, professional respect, and career opportunities, and have higher salaries and persistence intentions than STEM professionals in 31 other intersectional groups. Decomposition analyses illustrate that these advantages operate in part as premiums—benefits attached to WAHM status that cannot be attributed to variation in human capital, work effort, and other factors. These findings motivate research and policy efforts to move beyond a single axis paradigm to better understand and address intersectional (dis)advantages in STEM.},

The survey results revealed significant differences between non-minority groups and underrepresented minorities (URMs). A key difference was that URMs placed more emphasis on helping the environment and society when choosing a major, and, while they indicated an interest in science in math, often scored their abilities lower than their non-minority counterparts. The survey also revealed that all students viewed the geosciences as unfavorable for job prospects compared to other sciences such as biology and chemistry. The study highlights the need to educate the general public about the geosciences, as many undergraduate students are unaware of what kind of science they entail, which coursework is required to pursue them, and what career opportunities exist. URMs in particular might be unaware of how a career in the geosciences might align with their interests.},
